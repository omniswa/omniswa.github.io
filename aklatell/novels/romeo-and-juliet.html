      On the fore-finger of an alderman,<br>
      Drawn with a team of little atomies<br>
      Over men’s noses as they lie asleep:<br>
      Her waggon-spokes made of long spinners’ legs;<br>

      Her whip of cricket’s bone; the lash, of film;<br>

      And in this state she gallops night by night<br>
      Through lovers’ brains, and then they dream of love;<br>
      O’er courtiers’ knees, that dream on curtsies straight;<br>
      O’er lawyers’ fingers, who straight dream on fees;<br>
      O’er ladies’ lips, who straight on kisses dream,<br>
      Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues,<br>
      Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are:<br>
      Sometime she gallops o’er a courtier’s nose,<br>

      Tickling a parson’s nose as a lies asleep,<br>
      Then dreams he of another benefice:<br>
      Sometime she driveth o’er a soldier’s neck,<br>
      And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,<br>
      Of breaches, ambuscados, Spanish blades,<br>
      Of healths five fathom deep; and then anon<br>
      Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes;<br>
      And, being thus frighted, swears a prayer or two,<br>
      And sleeps again. This is that very Mab<br>
      That plats the manes of horses in the night;<br>
      And bakes the elf-locks in foul sluttish hairs,<br>
      Which, once untangled, much misfortune bodes:<br>

      There is no world without Verona walls,<br>
      But purgatory, torture, hell itself.<br>
      Hence banished is banish’d from the world,<br>
      And world’s exile is death. Then banished<br>
      Is death misterm’d. Calling death banished,<br>

      Thy fault our law calls death, but the kind Prince,<br>
      Taking thy part, hath brush’d aside the law,<br>
      And turn’d that black word death to banishment.<br>

      And little mouse, every unworthy thing,<br>
      Live here in heaven and may look on her,<br>
      But Romeo may not. More validity,<br>
      More honourable state, more courtship lives<br>
      In carrion flies than Romeo. They may seize<br>
      On the white wonder of dear Juliet’s hand,<br>
      And steal immortal blessing from her lips,<br>
      Who, even in pure and vestal modesty<br>
      Still blush, as thinking their own kisses sin.<br>
      But Romeo may not, he is banished.<br>
      This may flies do, when I from this must fly.<br>
      They are free men but I am banished.<br>

      Hadst thou no poison mix’d, no sharp-ground knife,<br>
      No sudden mean of death, though ne’er so mean,<br>
      But banished to kill me? Banished?<br>
      O Friar, the damned use that word in hell.<br>
      Howling attends it. How hast thou the heart,<br>
      Being a divine, a ghostly confessor,<br>
      A sin-absolver, and my friend profess’d,<br>

      As that is desperate which we would prevent.<br>

      Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet,<br>

      To County Paris. Then comes she to me,<br>
      And with wild looks, bid me devise some means<br>
      To rid her from this second marriage,<br>
      Or in my cell there would she kill herself.<br>
      Then gave I her, so tutored by my art,<br>
      A sleeping potion, which so took effect<br>
      As I intended, for it wrought on her<br>
      The form of death. Meantime I writ to Romeo<br>

      But then a noise did scare me from the tomb;<br>
      And she, too desperate, would not go with me,<br>

      MONTAGUE.<br>
      But I can give thee more,<br>
      For I will raise her statue in pure gold,<br>
      That whiles Verona by that name is known,<br>
      There shall no figure at such rate be set<br>
      As that of true and faithful Juliet.

      CAPULET.<br>
      As rich shall Romeo’s by his lady’s lie,<br>
      Poor sacrifices of our enmity.

      PRINCE.<br>
      A glooming peace this morning with it brings;<br>
      The sun for sorrow will not show his head.<br>
      Go hence, to have more talk of these sad things.<br>
      Some shall be pardon’d, and some punished,<br>
      For never was a story of more woe<br>
      Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.
