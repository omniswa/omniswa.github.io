      CHAPTER I.<br>
      Mrs. Rachel Lynde Is Surprised</h2>
    
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>RS. Rachel Lynde lived
      just where the Avonlea main road dipped down into a little hollow, fringed with
      alders and ladies’ eardrops and traversed by a brook that had its source
      away back in the woods of the old Cuthbert place; it was reputed to be an
      intricate, headlong brook in its earlier course through those woods, with dark
      secrets of pool and cascade; but by the time it reached Lynde’s Hollow it
      was a quiet, well-conducted little stream, for not even a brook could run past
      Mrs. Rachel Lynde’s door without due regard for decency and decorum; it
      probably was conscious that Mrs. Rachel was sitting at her window, keeping a
      sharp eye on everything that passed, from brooks and children up, and that if
      she noticed anything odd or out of place she would never rest until she had
      ferreted out the whys and wherefores thereof.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      There are plenty of people, in Avonlea and out of it, who can attend closely to
      their neighbors’ business by dint of neglecting their own; but Mrs.
      Rachel Lynde was one of those capable creatures who can manage their own
      concerns and those of other folks into the bargain. She was a notable
      housewife; her work was always done and well done; she “ran” the
      Sewing Circle, helped run the Sunday-school, and was the strongest prop of the
      Church Aid Society and Foreign Missions Auxiliary. Yet with all this Mrs.
      Rachel found abundant time to sit for hours at her kitchen window, knitting
      “cotton warp” quilts—she had knitted sixteen of them, as
      Avonlea housekeepers were wont to tell in awed voices—and keeping a sharp
      eye on the main road that crossed the hollow and wound up the steep red hill
      beyond. Since Avonlea occupied a little triangular peninsula jutting out into
      the Gulf of St. Lawrence, with water on two sides of it, anybody who went out of
      it or into it had to pass over that hill road and so run the unseen gauntlet of
      Mrs. Rachel’s all-seeing eye.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      She was sitting there one afternoon in early June. The sun was coming in at the
      window warm and bright; the orchard on the slope below the house was in a
      bridal flush of pinky-white bloom, hummed over by a myriad of bees. Thomas
      Lynde—a meek little man whom Avonlea people called “Rachel
      Lynde’s husband”—was sowing his late turnip seed on the hill
      field beyond the barn; and Matthew Cuthbert ought to have been sowing his on
      the big red brook field away over by Green Gables. Mrs. Rachel knew that he
      ought because she had heard him tell Peter Morrison the evening before in
      William J. Blair’s store over at Carmody that he meant to sow his turnip
      seed the next afternoon. Peter had asked him, of course, for Matthew Cuthbert
      had never been known to volunteer information about anything in his whole life.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      And yet here was Matthew Cuthbert, at half-past three on the afternoon of a
      busy day, placidly driving over the hollow and up the hill; moreover, he wore a
      white collar and his best suit of clothes, which was plain proof that he was
      going out of Avonlea; and he had the buggy and the sorrel mare, which betokened
      that he was going a considerable distance. Now, where was Matthew Cuthbert
      going and why was he going there?
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Had it been any other man in Avonlea, Mrs. Rachel, deftly putting this and that
      together, might have given a pretty good guess as to both questions. But
      Matthew so rarely went from home that it must be something pressing and unusual
      which was taking him; he was the shyest man alive and hated to have to go among
      strangers or to any place where he might have to talk. Matthew, dressed up with
      a white collar and driving in a buggy, was something that didn’t happen
      often. Mrs. Rachel, ponder as she might, could make nothing of it and her
      afternoon’s enjoyment was spoiled.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I’ll just step over to Green Gables after tea and find out from
      Marilla where he’s gone and why,” the worthy woman finally
      concluded. “He doesn’t generally go to town this time of year and
      he <i>never</i> visits; if he’d run out of turnip seed he wouldn’t
      dress up and take the buggy to go for more; he wasn’t driving fast enough
      to be going for a doctor. Yet something must have happened since last night to
      start him off. I’m clean puzzled, that’s what, and I won’t
      know a minute’s peace of mind or conscience until I know what has taken
      Matthew Cuthbert out of Avonlea today.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Accordingly after tea Mrs. Rachel set out; she had not far to go; the big,
      rambling, orchard-embowered house where the Cuthberts lived was a scant quarter
      of a mile up the road from Lynde’s Hollow. To be sure, the long lane made
      it a good deal further. Matthew Cuthbert’s father, as shy and silent as
      his son after him, had got as far away as he possibly could from his fellow men
      without actually retreating into the woods when he founded his homestead. Green
      Gables was built at the furthest edge of his cleared land and there it was to
      this day, barely visible from the main road along which all the other Avonlea
      houses were so sociably situated. Mrs. Rachel Lynde did not call living in such
      a place <i>living</i> at all.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “It’s just <i>staying</i>, that’s what,” she said as
      she stepped along the deep-rutted, grassy lane bordered with wild rose bushes.
      “It’s no wonder Matthew and Marilla are both a little odd, living
      away back here by themselves. Trees aren’t much company, though dear
      knows if they were there’d be enough of them. I’d ruther look at
      people. To be sure, they seem contented enough; but then, I suppose,
      they’re used to it. A body can get used to anything, even to being
      hanged, as the Irishman said.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      With this Mrs. Rachel stepped out of the lane into the backyard of Green
      Gables. Very green and neat and precise was that yard, set about on one side
      with great patriarchal willows and on the other with prim Lombardies. Not a stray
      stick nor stone was to be seen, for Mrs. Rachel would have seen it if there had
      been. Privately she was of the opinion that Marilla Cuthbert swept that yard
      over as often as she swept her house. One could have eaten a meal off the
      ground without overbrimming the proverbial peck of dirt.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Mrs. Rachel rapped smartly at the kitchen door and stepped in when bidden to do
      so. The kitchen at Green Gables was a cheerful apartment—or would have
      been cheerful if it had not been so painfully clean as to give it something of
      the appearance of an unused parlor. Its windows looked east and west; through
      the west one, looking out on the back yard, came a flood of mellow June
      sunlight; but the east one, whence you got a glimpse of the bloom white
      cherry-trees in the left orchard and nodding, slender birches down in the
      hollow by the brook, was greened over by a tangle of vines. Here sat Marilla
      Cuthbert, when she sat at all, always slightly distrustful of sunshine, which
      seemed to her too dancing and irresponsible a thing for a world which was meant
      to be taken seriously; and here she sat now, knitting, and the table behind her
      was laid for supper.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Mrs. Rachel, before she had fairly closed the door, had taken a mental note of
      everything that was on that table. There were three plates laid, so that
      Marilla must be expecting some one home with Matthew to tea; but the dishes
      were everyday dishes and there was only crab-apple preserves and one kind of
      cake, so that the expected company could not be any particular company. Yet
      what of Matthew’s white collar and the sorrel mare? Mrs. Rachel was
      getting fairly dizzy with this unusual mystery about quiet, unmysterious Green
      Gables.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Good evening, Rachel,” Marilla said briskly. “This is a real
      fine evening, isn’t it? Won’t you sit down? How are all your
      folks?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Something that for lack of any other name might be called friendship existed
      and always had existed between Marilla Cuthbert and Mrs. Rachel, in spite
      of—or perhaps because of—their dissimilarity.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Marilla was a tall, thin woman, with angles and without curves; her dark hair
      showed some gray streaks and was always twisted up in a hard little knot behind
      with two wire hairpins stuck aggressively through it. She looked like a woman
      of narrow experience and rigid conscience, which she was; but there was a
      saving something about her mouth which, if it had been ever so slightly
      developed, might have been considered indicative of a sense of humor.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “We’re all pretty well,” said Mrs. Rachel. “I was kind
      of afraid <i>you</i> weren’t, though, when I saw Matthew starting off
      today. I thought maybe he was going to the doctor’s.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Marilla’s lips twitched understandingly. She had expected Mrs. Rachel up;
      she had known that the sight of Matthew jaunting off so unaccountably would be
      too much for her neighbor’s curiosity.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Oh, no, I’m quite well although I had a bad headache
      yesterday,” she said. “Matthew went to Bright River. We’re
      getting a little boy from an orphan asylum in Nova Scotia and he’s coming
      on the train tonight.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      If Marilla had said that Matthew had gone to Bright River to meet a kangaroo
      from Australia Mrs. Rachel could not have been more astonished. She was
      actually stricken dumb for five seconds. It was unsupposable that Marilla was
      making fun of her, but Mrs. Rachel was almost forced to suppose it.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Are you in earnest, Marilla?” she demanded when voice returned to
      her.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Yes, of course,” said Marilla, as if getting boys from orphan
      asylums in Nova Scotia were part of the usual spring work on any well-regulated
      Avonlea farm instead of being an unheard of innovation.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Mrs. Rachel felt that she had received a severe mental jolt. She thought in
      exclamation points. A boy! Marilla and Matthew Cuthbert of all people adopting
      a boy! From an orphan asylum! Well, the world was certainly turning upside
      down! She would be surprised at nothing after this! Nothing!
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “What on earth put such a notion into your head?” she demanded
      disapprovingly.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      This had been done without her advice being asked, and must perforce be
      disapproved.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Well, we’ve been thinking about it for some time—all winter
      in fact,” returned Marilla. “Mrs. Alexander Spencer was up here one
      day before Christmas and she said she was going to get a little girl from the
      asylum over in Hopeton in the spring. Her cousin lives there and Mrs. Spencer
      has visited her and knows all about it. So Matthew and I have talked it over
      off and on ever since. We thought we’d get a boy. Matthew is getting up
      in years, you know—he’s sixty—and he isn’t so spry as
      he once was. His heart troubles him a good deal. And you know how desperate
      hard it’s got to be to get hired help. There’s never anybody to be
      had but those stupid, half-grown little French boys; and as soon as you do get
      one broke into your ways and taught something he’s up and off to the
      lobster canneries or the States. At first Matthew suggested getting a Home boy.
      But I said ‘no’ flat to that. ‘They may be all
      right—I’m not saying they’re not—but no London street
      Arabs for me,’ I said. ‘Give me a native born at least.
      There’ll be a risk, no matter who we get. But I’ll feel easier in
      my mind and sleep sounder at nights if we get a born Canadian.’ So in the
      end we decided to ask Mrs. Spencer to pick us out one when she went over to get
      her little girl. We heard last week she was going, so we sent her word by
      Richard Spencer’s folks at Carmody to bring us a smart, likely boy of
      about ten or eleven. We decided that would be the best age—old enough to
      be of some use in doing chores right off and young enough to be trained up
      proper. We mean to give him a good home and schooling. We had a telegram from
      Mrs. Alexander Spencer today—the mail-man brought it from the
      station—saying they were coming on the five-thirty train tonight. So
      Matthew went to Bright River to meet him. Mrs. Spencer will drop him off there.
      Of course she goes on to White Sands station herself.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Mrs. Rachel prided herself on always speaking her mind; she proceeded to speak
      it now, having adjusted her mental attitude to this amazing piece of news.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Well, Marilla, I’ll just tell you plain that I think you’re
      doing a mighty foolish thing—a risky thing, that’s what. You
      don’t know what you’re getting. You’re bringing a strange
      child into your house and home and you don’t know a single thing about
      him nor what his disposition is like nor what sort of parents he had nor how
      he’s likely to turn out. Why, it was only last week I read in the paper
      how a man and his wife up west of the Island took a boy out of an orphan asylum
      and he set fire to the house at night—set it <i>on purpose</i>,
      Marilla—and nearly burnt them to a crisp in their beds. And I know
      another case where an adopted boy used to suck the eggs—they
      couldn’t break him of it. If you had asked my advice in the
      matter—which you didn’t do, Marilla—I’d have said for
      mercy’s sake not to think of such a thing, that’s what.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      This Job’s comforting seemed neither to offend nor to alarm Marilla. She
      knitted steadily on.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I don’t deny there’s something in what you say, Rachel.
      I’ve had some qualms myself. But Matthew was terrible set on it. I could
      see that, so I gave in. It’s so seldom Matthew sets his mind on anything
      that when he does I always feel it’s my duty to give in. And as for the
      risk, there’s risks in pretty near everything a body does in this world.
      There’s risks in people’s having children of their own if it comes
      to that—they don’t always turn out well. And then Nova Scotia is
      right close to the Island. It isn’t as if we were getting him from
      England or the States. He can’t be much different from ourselves.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Well, I hope it will turn out all right,” said Mrs. Rachel in a
      tone that plainly indicated her painful doubts. “Only don’t say I
      didn’t warn you if he burns Green Gables down or puts strychnine in the
      well—I heard of a case over in New Brunswick where an orphan asylum child
      did that and the whole family died in fearful agonies. Only, it was a girl in
      that instance.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Well, we’re not getting a girl,” said Marilla, as if
      poisoning wells were a purely feminine accomplishment and not to be dreaded in
      the case of a boy. “I’d never dream of taking a girl to bring up. I
      wonder at Mrs. Alexander Spencer for doing it. But there, <i>she</i>
      wouldn’t shrink from adopting a whole orphan asylum if she took it into
      her head.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Mrs. Rachel would have liked to stay until Matthew came home with his imported
      orphan. But reflecting that it would be a good two hours at least before his
      arrival she concluded to go up the road to Robert Bell’s and tell the
      news. It would certainly make a sensation second to none, and Mrs. Rachel
      dearly loved to make a sensation. So she took herself away, somewhat to
      Marilla’s relief, for the latter felt her doubts and fears reviving under
      the influence of Mrs. Rachel’s pessimism.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Well, of all things that ever were or will be!” ejaculated Mrs.
      Rachel when she was safely out in the lane. “It does really seem as if I
      must be dreaming. Well, I’m sorry for that poor young one and no mistake.
      Matthew and Marilla don’t know anything about children and they’ll
      expect him to be wiser and steadier than his own grandfather, if so be’s
      he ever had a grandfather, which is doubtful. It seems uncanny to think of a
      child at Green Gables somehow; there’s never been one there, for Matthew
      and Marilla were grown up when the new house was built—if they ever
      <i>were</i> children, which is hard to believe when one looks at them. I
      wouldn’t be in that orphan’s shoes for anything. My, but I pity
      him, that’s what.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      So said Mrs. Rachel to the wild rose bushes out of the fulness of her heart;
      but if she could have seen the child who was waiting patiently at the Bright
      River station at that very moment her pity would have been still deeper and
      more profound.

      CHAPTER II.<br>
      Matthew Cuthbert Is Surprised</h2>
    
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>ATTHEW Cuthbert and the
      sorrel mare jogged comfortably over the eight miles to Bright River. It was a
      pretty road, running along between snug farmsteads, with now and again a bit of
      balsamy fir wood to drive through or a hollow where wild plums hung out their
      filmy bloom. The air was sweet with the breath of many apple orchards and the
      meadows sloped away in the distance to horizon mists of pearl and purple; while
    </p>
    
    <p class="poem">
      “The little birds sang as if it were<br>
      The one day of summer in all the year.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Matthew enjoyed the drive after his own fashion, except during the moments when
      he met women and had to nod to them—for in Prince Edward Island you are
      supposed to nod to all and sundry you meet on the road whether you know them or
      not.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Matthew dreaded all women except Marilla and Mrs. Rachel; he had an
      uncomfortable feeling that the mysterious creatures were secretly laughing at
      him. He may have been quite right in thinking so, for he was an odd-looking
      personage, with an ungainly figure and long iron-gray hair that touched his
      stooping shoulders, and a full, soft brown beard which he had worn ever since
      he was twenty. In fact, he had looked at twenty very much as he looked at
      sixty, lacking a little of the grayness.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      When he reached Bright River there was no sign of any train; he thought he was
      too early, so he tied his horse in the yard of the small Bright River hotel and
      went over to the station house. The long platform was almost deserted; the only
      living creature in sight being a girl who was sitting on a pile of shingles at
      the extreme end. Matthew, barely noting that it <i>was</i> a girl, sidled past
      her as quickly as possible without looking at her. Had he looked he could
      hardly have failed to notice the tense rigidity and expectation of her attitude
      and expression. She was sitting there waiting for something or somebody and,
      since sitting and waiting was the only thing to do just then, she sat and
      waited with all her might and main.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Matthew encountered the stationmaster locking up the ticket office preparatory
      to going home for supper, and asked him if the five-thirty train would soon be
      along.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “The five-thirty train has been in and gone half an hour ago,”
      answered that brisk official. “But there was a passenger dropped off for
      you—a little girl. She’s sitting out there on the shingles. I asked
      her to go into the ladies’ waiting room, but she informed me gravely that
      she preferred to stay outside. ‘There was more scope for
      imagination,’ she said. She’s a case, I should say.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I’m not expecting a girl,” said Matthew blankly.
      “It’s a boy I’ve come for. He should be here. Mrs. Alexander
      Spencer was to bring him over from Nova Scotia for me.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The stationmaster whistled.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Guess there’s some mistake,” he said. “Mrs. Spencer
      came off the train with that girl and gave her into my charge. Said you and
      your sister were adopting her from an orphan asylum and that you would be along
      for her presently. That’s all I know about it—and I haven’t
      got any more orphans concealed hereabouts.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I don’t understand,” said Matthew helplessly, wishing that
      Marilla was at hand to cope with the situation.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Well, you’d better question the girl,” said the
      stationmaster carelessly. “I dare say she’ll be able to
      explain—she’s got a tongue of her own, that’s certain. Maybe
      they were out of boys of the brand you wanted.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      He walked jauntily away, being hungry, and the unfortunate Matthew was left to
      do that which was harder for him than bearding a lion in its den—walk up
      to a girl—a strange girl—an orphan girl—and demand of her why
      she wasn’t a boy. Matthew groaned in spirit as he turned about and
      shuffled gently down the platform towards her.

    <p>
      She had been watching him ever since he had passed her and she had her eyes on
      him now. Matthew was not looking at her and would not have seen what she was
      really like if he had been, but an ordinary observer would have seen this: A
      child of about eleven, garbed in a very short, very tight, very ugly dress of
      yellowish-gray wincey. She wore a faded brown sailor hat and beneath the hat,
      extending down her back, were two braids of very thick, decidedly red hair. Her
      face was small, white and thin, also much freckled; her mouth was large and so
      were her eyes, which looked green in some lights and moods and gray in others.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      So far, the ordinary observer; an extraordinary observer might have seen that
      the chin was very pointed and pronounced; that the big eyes were full of spirit
      and vivacity; that the mouth was sweet-lipped and expressive; that the forehead
      was broad and full; in short, our discerning extraordinary observer might have
      concluded that no commonplace soul inhabited the body of this stray woman-child
      of whom shy Matthew Cuthbert was so ludicrously afraid.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Matthew, however, was spared the ordeal of speaking first, for as soon as she
      concluded that he was coming to her she stood up, grasping with one thin brown
      hand the handle of a shabby, old-fashioned carpet-bag; the other she held out
      to him.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I suppose you are Mr. Matthew Cuthbert of Green Gables?” she said
      in a peculiarly clear, sweet voice. “I’m very glad to see you. I
      was beginning to be afraid you weren’t coming for me and I was imagining
      all the things that might have happened to prevent you. I had made up my mind
      that if you didn’t come for me tonight I’d go down the track to
      that big wild cherry-tree at the bend, and climb up into it to stay all night.
      I wouldn’t be a bit afraid, and it would be lovely to sleep in a wild
      cherry-tree all white with bloom in the moonshine, don’t you think? You
      could imagine you were dwelling in marble halls, couldn’t you? And I was
      quite sure you would come for me in the morning, if you didn’t
      tonight.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Matthew had taken the scrawny little hand awkwardly in his; then and there he
      decided what to do. He could not tell this child with the glowing eyes that
      there had been a mistake; he would take her home and let Marilla do that. She
      couldn’t be left at Bright River anyhow, no matter what mistake had been
      made, so all questions and explanations might as well be deferred until he was
      safely back at Green Gables.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I’m sorry I was late,” he said shyly. “Come along. The
      horse is over in the yard. Give me your bag.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Oh, I can carry it,” the child responded cheerfully. “It
      isn’t heavy. I’ve got all my worldly goods in it, but it
      isn’t heavy. And if it isn’t carried in just a certain way the
      handle pulls out—so I’d better keep it because I know the exact
      knack of it. It’s an extremely old carpet-bag. Oh, I’m very glad
      you’ve come, even if it would have been nice to sleep in a wild
      cherry-tree. We’ve got to drive a long piece, haven’t we? Mrs.
      Spencer said it was eight miles. I’m glad because I love driving. Oh, it
      seems so wonderful that I’m going to live with you and belong to you.
      I’ve never belonged to anybody—not really. But the asylum was the
      worst. I’ve only been in it four months, but that was enough. I
      don’t suppose you ever were an orphan in an asylum, so you can’t
      possibly understand what it is like. It’s worse than anything you could
      imagine. Mrs. Spencer said it was wicked of me to talk like that, but I
      didn’t mean to be wicked. It’s so easy to be wicked without knowing
      it, isn’t it? They were good, you know—the asylum people. But there
      is so little scope for the imagination in an asylum—only just in the
      other orphans. It was pretty interesting to imagine things about them—to
      imagine that perhaps the girl who sat next to you was really the daughter of a
      belted earl, who had been stolen away from her parents in her infancy by a
      cruel nurse who died before she could confess. I used to lie awake at nights
      and imagine things like that, because I didn’t have time in the day. I
      guess that’s why I’m so thin—I <i>am</i> dreadful thin,
      ain’t I? There isn’t a pick on my bones. I do love to imagine
      I’m nice and plump, with dimples in my elbows.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      With this Matthew’s companion stopped talking, partly because she was out
      of breath and partly because they had reached the buggy. Not another word did
      she say until they had left the village and were driving down a steep little
      hill, the road part of which had been cut so deeply into the soft soil that
      the banks, fringed with blooming wild cherry-trees and slim white birches, were
      several feet above their heads.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The child put out her hand and broke off a branch of wild plum that brushed
      against the side of the buggy.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Isn’t that beautiful? What did that tree, leaning out from the
      bank, all white and lacy, make you think of?” she asked.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Well now, I dunno,” said Matthew.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Why, a bride, of course—a bride all in white with a lovely misty
      veil. I’ve never seen one, but I can imagine what she would look like. I
      don’t ever expect to be a bride myself. I’m so homely nobody will
      ever want to marry me—unless it might be a foreign missionary. I suppose
      a foreign missionary mightn’t be very particular. But I do hope that some
      day I shall have a white dress. That is my highest ideal of earthly bliss. I
      just love pretty clothes. And I’ve never had a pretty dress in my life
      that I can remember—but of course it’s all the more to look forward
      to, isn’t it? And then I can imagine that I’m dressed gorgeously.
      This morning when I left the asylum I felt so ashamed because I had to wear
      this horrid old wincey dress. All the orphans had to wear them, you know. A
      merchant in Hopeton last winter donated three hundred yards of wincey to the
      asylum. Some people said it was because he couldn’t sell it, but
      I’d rather believe that it was out of the kindness of his heart,
      wouldn’t you? When we got on the train I felt as if everybody must be
      looking at me and pitying me. But I just went to work and imagined that I had
      on the most beautiful pale blue silk dress—because when you <i>are</i>
      imagining you might as well imagine something worth while—and a big hat
      all flowers and nodding plumes, and a gold watch, and kid gloves and boots. I
      felt cheered up right away and I enjoyed my trip to the Island with all my
      might. I wasn’t a bit sick coming over in the boat. Neither was Mrs.
      Spencer, although she generally is. She said she hadn’t time to get sick,
      watching to see that I didn’t fall overboard. She said she never saw the
      beat of me for prowling about. But if it kept her from being seasick it’s
      a mercy I did prowl, isn’t it? And I wanted to see everything that was to
      be seen on that boat, because I didn’t know whether I’d ever have
      another opportunity. Oh, there are a lot more cherry-trees all in bloom! This
      Island is the bloomiest place. I just love it already, and I’m so glad
      I’m going to live here. I’ve always heard that Prince Edward Island
      was the prettiest place in the world, and I used to imagine I was living here,
      but I never really expected I would. It’s delightful when your
      imaginations come true, isn’t it? But those red roads are so funny. When
      we got into the train at Charlottetown and the red roads began to flash past I
      asked Mrs. Spencer what made them red and she said she didn’t know and
      for pity’s sake not to ask her any more questions. She said I must have
      asked her a thousand already. I suppose I had, too, but how are you going to find
      out about things if you don’t ask questions? And what <i>does</i> make
      the roads red?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Well now, I dunno,” said Matthew.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Well, that is one of the things to find out sometime. Isn’t it
      splendid to think of all the things there are to find out about? It just makes
      me feel glad to be alive—it’s such an interesting world. It
      wouldn’t be half so interesting if we knew all about everything, would
      it? There’d be no scope for imagination then, would there? But am I
      talking too much? People are always telling me I do. Would you rather I
      didn’t talk? If you say so I’ll stop. I can <i>stop</i> when I make
      up my mind to it, although it’s difficult.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Matthew, much to his own surprise, was enjoying himself. Like most quiet folks
      he liked talkative people when they were willing to do the talking themselves
      and did not expect him to keep up his end of it. But he had never expected to
      enjoy the society of a little girl. Women were bad enough in all conscience,
      but little girls were worse. He detested the way they had of sidling past him
      timidly, with sidewise glances, as if they expected him to gobble them up at a
      mouthful if they ventured to say a word. That was the Avonlea type of well-bred
      little girl. But this freckled witch was very different, and although he found
      it rather difficult for his slower intelligence to keep up with her brisk
      mental processes he thought that he “kind of liked her chatter.” So
      he said as shyly as usual:
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Oh, you can talk as much as you like. I don’t mind.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Oh, I’m so glad. I know you and I are going to get along together
      fine. It’s such a relief to talk when one wants to and not be told that
      children should be seen and not heard. I’ve had that said to me a million
      times if I have once. And people laugh at me because I use big words. But if
      you have big ideas you have to use big words to express them, haven’t
      you?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Well now, that seems reasonable,” said Matthew.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Mrs. Spencer said that my tongue must be hung in the middle. But it
      isn’t—it’s firmly fastened at one end. Mrs. Spencer said your
      place was named Green Gables. I asked her all about it. And she said there were
      trees all around it. I was gladder than ever. I just love trees. And there
      weren’t any at all about the asylum, only a few poor weeny-teeny things
      out in front with little whitewashed cagey things about them. They just looked
      like orphans themselves, those trees did. It used to make me want to cry to
      look at them. I used to say to them, ‘Oh, you <i>poor</i> little things!
      If you were out in a great big woods with other trees all around you and little
      mosses and June bells growing over your roots and a brook not far away and
      birds singing in your branches, you could grow, couldn’t you? But you
      can’t where you are. I know just exactly how you feel, little
      trees.’ I felt sorry to leave them behind this morning. You do get so
      attached to things like that, don’t you? Is there a brook anywhere near
      Green Gables? I forgot to ask Mrs. Spencer that.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Well now, yes, there’s one right below the house.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Fancy. It’s always been one of my dreams to live near a brook. I
      never expected I would, though. Dreams don’t often come true, do they?
      Wouldn’t it be nice if they did? But just now I feel pretty nearly
      perfectly happy. I can’t feel exactly perfectly happy because—well,
      what color would you call this?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      She twitched one of her long glossy braids over her thin shoulder and held it
      up before Matthew’s eyes. Matthew was not used to deciding on the tints
      of ladies’ tresses, but in this case there couldn’t be much doubt.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “It’s red, ain’t it?” he said.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The girl let the braid drop back with a sigh that seemed to come from her very
      toes and to exhale forth all the sorrows of the ages.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Yes, it’s red,” she said resignedly. “Now you see why
      I can’t be perfectly happy. Nobody could who has red hair. I don’t
      mind the other things so much—the freckles and the green eyes and my
      skinniness. I can imagine them away. I can imagine that I have a beautiful
      rose-leaf complexion and lovely starry violet eyes. But I <i>cannot</i> imagine
      that red hair away. I do my best. I think to myself, ‘Now my hair is a
      glorious black, black as the raven’s wing.’ But all the time I
      <i>know</i> it is just plain red and it breaks my heart. It will be my lifelong
      sorrow. I read of a girl once in a novel who had a lifelong sorrow but it
      wasn’t red hair. Her hair was pure gold rippling back from her alabaster
      brow. What is an alabaster brow? I never could find out. Can you tell
      me?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Well now, I’m afraid I can’t,” said Matthew, who was
      getting a little dizzy. He felt as he had once felt in his rash youth when
      another boy had enticed him on the merry-go-round at a picnic.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Well, whatever it was it must have been something nice because she was
      divinely beautiful. Have you ever imagined what it must feel like to be
      divinely beautiful?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Well now, no, I haven’t,” confessed Matthew ingenuously.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I have, often. Which would you rather be if you had the
      choice—divinely beautiful or dazzlingly clever or angelically
      good?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Well now, I—I don’t know exactly.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Neither do I. I can never decide. But it doesn’t make much real
      difference for it isn’t likely I’ll ever be either. It’s
      certain I’ll never be angelically good. Mrs. Spencer says—oh, Mr.
      Cuthbert! Oh, Mr. Cuthbert!! Oh, Mr. Cuthbert!!!”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      That was not what Mrs. Spencer had said; neither had the child tumbled out of
      the buggy nor had Matthew done anything astonishing. They had simply rounded a
      curve in the road and found themselves in the “Avenue.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The “Avenue,” so called by the Newbridge people, was a stretch of
      road four or five hundred yards long, completely arched over with huge,
      wide-spreading apple-trees, planted years ago by an eccentric old farmer.
      Overhead was one long canopy of snowy fragrant bloom. Below the boughs the air
      was full of a purple twilight and far ahead a glimpse of painted sunset sky
      shone like a great rose window at the end of a cathedral aisle.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Its beauty seemed to strike the child dumb. She leaned back in the buggy, her
      thin hands clasped before her, her face lifted rapturously to the white
      splendor above. Even when they had passed out and were driving down the long
      slope to Newbridge she never moved or spoke. Still with rapt face she gazed
      afar into the sunset west, with eyes that saw visions trooping splendidly
      across that glowing background. Through Newbridge, a bustling little village
      where dogs barked at them and small boys hooted and curious faces peered from
      the windows, they drove, still in silence. When three more miles had dropped
      away behind them the child had not spoken. She could keep silence, it was
      evident, as energetically as she could talk.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I guess you’re feeling pretty tired and hungry,” Matthew
      ventured to say at last, accounting for her long visitation of dumbness with
      the only reason he could think of. “But we haven’t very far to go
      now—only another mile.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      She came out of her reverie with a deep sigh and looked at him with the dreamy
      gaze of a soul that had been wondering afar, star-led.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Oh, Mr. Cuthbert,” she whispered, “that place we came
      through—that white place—what was it?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Well now, you must mean the Avenue,” said Matthew after a few
      moments’ profound reflection. “It is a kind of pretty place.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Pretty? Oh, <i>pretty</i> doesn’t seem the right word to use. Nor
      beautiful, either. They don’t go far enough. Oh, it was
      wonderful—wonderful. It’s the first thing I ever saw that
      couldn’t be improved upon by imagination. It just satisfied me
      here”—she put one hand on her breast—“it made a queer
      funny ache and yet it was a pleasant ache. Did you ever have an ache like that,
      Mr. Cuthbert?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Well now, I just can’t recollect that I ever had.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I have it lots of times—whenever I see anything royally beautiful.
      But they shouldn’t call that lovely place the Avenue. There is no meaning
      in a name like that. They should call it—let me see—the White Way
      of Delight. Isn’t that a nice imaginative name? When I don’t like
      the name of a place or a person I always imagine a new one and always think of
      them so. There was a girl at the asylum whose name was Hepzibah Jenkins, but I
      always imagined her as Rosalia DeVere. Other people may call that place the
      Avenue, but I shall always call it the White Way of Delight. Have we really
      only another mile to go before we get home? I’m glad and I’m sorry.
      I’m sorry because this drive has been so pleasant and I’m always
      sorry when pleasant things end. Something still pleasanter may come after, but
      you can never be sure. And it’s so often the case that it isn’t
      pleasanter. That has been my experience anyhow. But I’m glad to think of
      getting home. You see, I’ve never had a real home since I can remember.
      It gives me that pleasant ache again just to think of coming to a really truly
      home. Oh, isn’t that pretty!”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      They had driven over the crest of a hill. Below them was a pond, looking almost
      like a river so long and winding was it. A bridge spanned it midway and from
      there to its lower end, where an amber-hued belt of sand-hills shut it in from
      the dark blue gulf beyond, the water was a glory of many shifting
      hues—the most spiritual shadings of crocus and rose and ethereal green,
      with other elusive tintings for which no name has ever been found. Above the
      bridge the pond ran up into fringing groves of fir and maple and lay all darkly
      translucent in their wavering shadows. Here and there a wild plum leaned out
      from the bank like a white-clad girl tiptoeing to her own reflection. From the
      marsh at the head of the pond came the clear, mournfully-sweet chorus of the
      frogs. There was a little gray house peering around a white apple orchard on a
      slope beyond and, although it was not yet quite dark, a light was shining from
      one of its windows.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “That’s Barry’s pond,” said Matthew.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Oh, I don’t like that name, either. I shall call it—let me
      see—the Lake of Shining Waters. Yes, that is the right name for it. I
      know because of the thrill. When I hit on a name that suits exactly it gives me
      a thrill. Do things ever give you a thrill?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Matthew ruminated.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Well now, yes. It always kind of gives me a thrill to see them ugly
      white grubs that spade up in the cucumber beds. I hate the look of them.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Oh, I don’t think that can be exactly the same kind of a thrill.
      Do you think it can? There doesn’t seem to be much connection between
      grubs and lakes of shining waters, does there? But why do other people call it
      Barry’s pond?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I reckon because Mr. Barry lives up there in that house. Orchard
      Slope’s the name of his place. If it wasn’t for that big bush
      behind it you could see Green Gables from here. But we have to go over the
      bridge and round by the road, so it’s near half a mile further.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Has Mr. Barry any little girls? Well, not so very little
      either—about my size.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “He’s got one about eleven. Her name is Diana.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Oh!” with a long indrawing of breath. “What a perfectly
      lovely name!”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Well now, I dunno. There’s something dreadful heathenish about it,
      seems to me. I’d ruther Jane or Mary or some sensible name like that. But
      when Diana was born there was a schoolmaster boarding there and they gave him
      the naming of her and he called her Diana.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I wish there had been a schoolmaster like that around when I was born,
      then. Oh, here we are at the bridge. I’m going to shut my eyes tight.
      I’m always afraid going over bridges. I can’t help imagining that
      perhaps, just as we get to the middle, they’ll crumple up like a
      jack-knife and nip us. So I shut my eyes. But I always have to open them for
      all when I think we’re getting near the middle. Because, you see, if the
      bridge <i>did</i> crumple up I’d want to <i>see</i> it crumple. What a
      jolly rumble it makes! I always like the rumble part of it. Isn’t it
      splendid there are so many things to like in this world? There, we’re
      over. Now I’ll look back. Good night, dear Lake of Shining Waters. I
      always say good night to the things I love, just as I would to people. I think
      they like it. That water looks as if it was smiling at me.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      When they had driven up the further hill and around a corner Matthew said:
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “We’re pretty near home now. That’s Green Gables
      over—”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Oh, don’t tell me,” she interrupted breathlessly, catching
      at his partially raised arm and shutting her eyes that she might not see his
      gesture. “Let me guess. I’m sure I’ll guess right.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      She opened her eyes and looked about her. They were on the crest of a hill. The
      sun had set some time since, but the landscape was still clear in the mellow
      afterlight. To the west a dark church spire rose up against a marigold sky.
      Below was a little valley and beyond a long, gently-rising slope with snug
      farmsteads scattered along it. From one to another the child’s eyes
      darted, eager and wistful. At last they lingered on one away to the left, far
      back from the road, dimly white with blossoming trees in the twilight of the
      surrounding woods. Over it, in the stainless southwest sky, a great
      crystal-white star was shining like a lamp of guidance and promise.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “That’s it, isn’t it?” she said, pointing.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Matthew slapped the reins on the sorrel’s back delightedly.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Well now, you’ve guessed it! But I reckon Mrs. Spencer described
      it so’s you could tell.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “No, she didn’t—really she didn’t. All she said might
      just as well have been about most of those other places. I hadn’t any
      real idea what it looked like. But just as soon as I saw it I felt it was home.
      Oh, it seems as if I must be in a dream. Do you know, my arm must be black and
      blue from the elbow up, for I’ve pinched myself so many times today.
      Every little while a horrible sickening feeling would come over me and
      I’d be so afraid it was all a dream. Then I’d pinch myself to see
      if it was real—until suddenly I remembered that even supposing it was
      only a dream I’d better go on dreaming as long as I could; so I stopped
      pinching. But it <i>is</i> real and we’re nearly home.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      With a sigh of rapture she relapsed into silence. Matthew stirred uneasily. He
      felt glad that it would be Marilla and not he who would have to tell this waif
      of the world that the home she longed for was not to be hers after all. They
      drove over Lynde’s Hollow, where it was already quite dark, but not so
      dark that Mrs. Rachel could not see them from her window vantage, and up the
      hill and into the long lane of Green Gables. By the time they arrived at the
      house Matthew was shrinking from the approaching revelation with an energy he
      did not understand. It was not of Marilla or himself he was thinking or of the
      trouble this mistake was probably going to make for them, but of the
      child’s disappointment. When he thought of that rapt light being quenched
      in her eyes he had an uncomfortable feeling that he was going to assist at
      murdering something—much the same feeling that came over him when he had
      to kill a lamb or calf or any other innocent little creature.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The yard was quite dark as they turned into it and the poplar leaves were
      rustling silkily all round it.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Listen to the trees talking in their sleep,” she whispered, as he
      lifted her to the ground. “What nice dreams they must have!”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Then, holding tightly to the carpet-bag which contained “all her worldly
      goods,” she followed him into the house.

      CHAPTER III.<br>
      Marilla Cuthbert Is Surprised</h2>
    
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>ARILLA came briskly
      forward as Matthew opened the door. But when her eyes fell on the odd little
      figure in the stiff, ugly dress, with the long braids of red hair and the
      eager, luminous eyes, she stopped short in amazement.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Matthew Cuthbert, who’s that?” she ejaculated. “Where
      is the boy?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “There wasn’t any boy,” said Matthew wretchedly. “There
      was only <i>her</i>.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      He nodded at the child, remembering that he had never even asked her name.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “No boy! But there <i>must</i> have been a boy,” insisted Marilla.
      “We sent word to Mrs. Spencer to bring a boy.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Well, she didn’t. She brought <i>her</i>. I asked the
      stationmaster. And I had to bring her home. She couldn’t be left there,
      no matter where the mistake had come in.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Well, this is a pretty piece of business!” ejaculated Marilla.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      During this dialogue the child had remained silent, her eyes roving from one to
      the other, all the animation fading out of her face. Suddenly she seemed to
      grasp the full meaning of what had been said. Dropping her precious carpet-bag
      she sprang forward a step and clasped her hands.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “You don’t want me!” she cried. “You don’t want
      me because I’m not a boy! I might have expected it. Nobody ever did want
      me. I might have known it was all too beautiful to last. I might have known
      nobody really did want me. Oh, what shall I do? I’m going to burst into
      tears!”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Burst into tears she did. Sitting down on a chair by the table, flinging her
      arms out upon it, and burying her face in them, she proceeded to cry stormily.
      Marilla and Matthew looked at each other deprecatingly across the stove.
      Neither of them knew what to say or do. Finally Marilla stepped lamely into the
      breach.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Well, well, there’s no need to cry so about it.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Yes, there <i>is</i> need!” The child raised her head quickly,
      revealing a tear-stained face and trembling lips. “<i>You</i> would cry,
      too, if you were an orphan and had come to a place you thought was going to be
      home and found that they didn’t want you because you weren’t a boy.
      Oh, this is the most <i>tragical</i> thing that ever happened to me!”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Something like a reluctant smile, rather rusty from long disuse, mellowed
      Marilla’s grim expression.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Well, don’t cry any more. We’re not going to turn you
      out-of-doors tonight. You’ll have to stay here until we investigate this
      affair. What’s your name?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The child hesitated for a moment.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Will you please call me Cordelia?” she said eagerly.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “<i>Call</i> you Cordelia? Is that your name?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “No-o-o, it’s not exactly my name, but I would love to be called
      Cordelia. It’s such a perfectly elegant name.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I don’t know what on earth you mean. If Cordelia isn’t your
      name, what is?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Anne Shirley,” reluctantly faltered forth the owner of that name,
      “but, oh, please do call me Cordelia. It can’t matter much to you
      what you call me if I’m only going to be here a little while, can it? And
      Anne is such an unromantic name.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Unromantic fiddlesticks!” said the unsympathetic Marilla.
      “Anne is a real good plain sensible name. You’ve no need to be
      ashamed of it.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Oh, I’m not ashamed of it,” explained Anne, “only I
      like Cordelia better. I’ve always imagined that my name was
      Cordelia—at least, I always have of late years. When I was young I used
      to imagine it was Geraldine, but I like Cordelia better now. But if you call me
      Anne please call me Anne spelled with an E.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “What difference does it make how it’s spelled?” asked
      Marilla with another rusty smile as she picked up the teapot.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Oh, it makes <i>such</i> a difference. It <i>looks</i> so much nicer.
      When you hear a name pronounced can’t you always see it in your mind,
      just as if it was printed out? I can; and A-n-n looks dreadful, but A-n-n-e
      looks so much more distinguished. If you’ll only call me Anne spelled
      with an E I shall try to reconcile myself to not being called Cordelia.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Very well, then, Anne spelled with an E, can you tell us how this
      mistake came to be made? We sent word to Mrs. Spencer to bring us a boy. Were
      there no boys at the asylum?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Oh, yes, there was an abundance of them. But Mrs. Spencer said
      <i>distinctly</i> that you wanted a girl about eleven years old. And the matron
      said she thought I would do. You don’t know how delighted I was. I
      couldn’t sleep all last night for joy. Oh,” she added
      reproachfully, turning to Matthew, “why didn’t you tell me at the
      station that you didn’t want me and leave me there? If I hadn’t
      seen the White Way of Delight and the Lake of Shining Waters it wouldn’t
      be so hard.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “What on earth does she mean?” demanded Marilla, staring at
      Matthew.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “She—she’s just referring to some conversation we had on the
      road,” said Matthew hastily. “I’m going out to put the mare
      in, Marilla. Have tea ready when I come back.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Did Mrs. Spencer bring anybody over besides you?” continued
      Marilla when Matthew had gone out.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “She brought Lily Jones for herself. Lily is only five years old and she
      is very beautiful and had nut-brown hair. If I was very beautiful and had
      nut-brown hair would you keep me?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “No. We want a boy to help Matthew on the farm. A girl would be of no use
      to us. Take off your hat. I’ll lay it and your bag on the hall
      table.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Anne took off her hat meekly. Matthew came back presently and they sat down to
      supper. But Anne could not eat. In vain she nibbled at the bread and butter and
      pecked at the crab-apple preserve out of the little scalloped glass dish by her
      plate. She did not really make any headway at all.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “You’re not eating anything,” said Marilla sharply, eying her
      as if it were a serious shortcoming. Anne sighed.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I can’t. I’m in the depths of despair. Can you eat when you
      are in the depths of despair?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I’ve never been in the depths of despair, so I can’t
      say,” responded Marilla.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Weren’t you? Well, did you ever try to <i>imagine</i> you were in
      the depths of despair?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “No, I didn’t.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Then I don’t think you can understand what it’s like.
      It’s a very uncomfortable feeling indeed. When you try to eat a lump
      comes right up in your throat and you can’t swallow anything, not even if
      it was a chocolate caramel. I had one chocolate caramel once two years ago and
      it was simply delicious. I’ve often dreamed since then that I had a lot
      of chocolate caramels, but I always wake up just when I’m going to eat
      them. I do hope you won’t be offended because I can’t eat.
      Everything is extremely nice, but still I cannot eat.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I guess she’s tired,” said Matthew, who hadn’t spoken
      since his return from the barn. “Best put her to bed, Marilla.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Marilla had been wondering where Anne should be put to bed. She had prepared a
      couch in the kitchen chamber for the desired and expected boy. But, although it
      was neat and clean, it did not seem quite the thing to put a girl there
      somehow. But the spare room was out of the question for such a stray waif, so
      there remained only the east gable room. Marilla lighted a candle and told Anne
      to follow her, which Anne spiritlessly did, taking her hat and carpet-bag from
      the hall table as she passed. The hall was fearsomely clean; the little gable
      chamber in which she presently found herself seemed still cleaner.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Marilla set the candle on a three-legged, three-cornered table and turned down
      the bedclothes.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I suppose you have a nightgown?” she questioned.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Anne nodded.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Yes, I have two. The matron of the asylum made them for me.
      They’re fearfully skimpy. There is never enough to go around in an
      asylum, so things are always skimpy—at least in a poor asylum like ours.
      I hate skimpy night-dresses. But one can dream just as well in them as in
      lovely trailing ones, with frills around the neck, that’s one
      consolation.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Well, undress as quick as you can and go to bed. I’ll come back in
      a few minutes for the candle. I daren’t trust you to put it out yourself.
      You’d likely set the place on fire.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      When Marilla had gone Anne looked around her wistfully. The whitewashed walls
      were so painfully bare and staring that she thought they must ache over their
      own bareness. The floor was bare, too, except for a round braided mat in the
      middle such as Anne had never seen before. In one corner was the bed, a high,
      old-fashioned one, with four dark, low-turned posts. In the other corner was
      the aforesaid three-cornered table adorned with a fat, red velvet pincushion
      hard enough to turn the point of the most adventurous pin. Above it hung a
      little six-by-eight mirror. Midway between table and bed was the window, with
      an icy white muslin frill over it, and opposite it was the wash-stand. The
      whole apartment was of a rigidity not to be described in words, but which sent
      a shiver to the very marrow of Anne’s bones. With a sob she hastily
      discarded her garments, put on the skimpy nightgown and sprang into bed where
      she burrowed face downward into the pillow and pulled the clothes over her
      head. When Marilla came up for the light various skimpy articles of raiment
      scattered most untidily over the floor and a certain tempestuous appearance of
      the bed were the only indications of any presence save her own.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      She deliberately picked up Anne’s clothes, placed them neatly on a prim
      yellow chair, and then, taking up the candle, went over to the bed.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Good night,” she said, a little awkwardly, but not unkindly.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Anne’s white face and big eyes appeared over the bedclothes with a
      startling suddenness.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “How can you call it a <i>good</i> night when you know it must be the
      very worst night I’ve ever had?” she said reproachfully.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Then she dived down into invisibility again.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Marilla went slowly down to the kitchen and proceeded to wash the supper
      dishes. Matthew was smoking—a sure sign of perturbation of mind. He
      seldom smoked, for Marilla set her face against it as a filthy habit; but at
      certain times and seasons he felt driven to it and then Marilla winked at the
      practice, realizing that a mere man must have some vent for his emotions.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Well, this is a pretty kettle of fish,” she said wrathfully.
      “This is what comes of sending word instead of going ourselves. Richard
      Spencer’s folks have twisted that message somehow. One of us will have to
      drive over and see Mrs. Spencer tomorrow, that’s certain. This girl will
      have to be sent back to the asylum.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Yes, I suppose so,” said Matthew reluctantly.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “You <i>suppose</i> so! Don’t you know it?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Well now, she’s a real nice little thing, Marilla. It’s kind
      of a pity to send her back when she’s so set on staying here.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Matthew Cuthbert, you don’t mean to say you think we ought to keep
      her!”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Marilla’s astonishment could not have been greater if Matthew had
      expressed a predilection for standing on his head.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Well, now, no, I suppose not—not exactly,” stammered
      Matthew, uncomfortably driven into a corner for his precise meaning. “I
      suppose—we could hardly be expected to keep her.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I should say not. What good would she be to us?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “We might be some good to her,” said Matthew suddenly and
      unexpectedly.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Matthew Cuthbert, I believe that child has bewitched you! I can see as
      plain as plain that you want to keep her.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Well now, she’s a real interesting little thing,” persisted
      Matthew. “You should have heard her talk coming from the station.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Oh, she can talk fast enough. I saw that at once. It’s nothing in
      her favor, either. I don’t like children who have so much to say. I
      don’t want an orphan girl and if I did she isn’t the style
      I’d pick out. There’s something I don’t understand about her.
      No, she’s got to be despatched straightway back to where she came
      from.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I could hire a French boy to help me,” said Matthew, “and
      she’d be company for you.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I’m not suffering for company,” said Marilla shortly.
      “And I’m not going to keep her.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Well now, it’s just as you say, of course, Marilla,” said
      Matthew rising and putting his pipe away. “I’m going to bed.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      To bed went Matthew. And to bed, when she had put her dishes away, went
      Marilla, frowning most resolutely. And up-stairs, in the east gable, a lonely,
      heart-hungry, friendless child cried herself to sleep.

    <h2><a id="link2HCH0004"></a>
      CHAPTER IV.<br>
      Morning at Green Gables</h2>
    
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>T was broad daylight
      when Anne awoke and sat up in bed, staring confusedly at the window through
      which a flood of cheery sunshine was pouring and outside of which something
      white and feathery waved across glimpses of blue sky.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      For a moment she could not remember where she was. First came a delightful
      thrill, as of something very pleasant; then a horrible remembrance. This was Green
      Gables and they didn’t want her because she wasn’t a boy!
    </p>
    
    <p>
      But it was morning and, yes, it was a cherry-tree in full bloom outside of her
      window. With a bound she was out of bed and across the floor. She pushed up the
      sash—it went up stiffly and creakily, as if it hadn’t been opened
      for a long time, which was the case; and it stuck so tight that nothing was
      needed to hold it up.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Anne dropped on her knees and gazed out into the June morning, her eyes
      glistening with delight. Oh, wasn’t it beautiful? Wasn’t it a
      lovely place? Suppose she wasn’t really going to stay here! She would
      imagine she was. There was scope for imagination here.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      A huge cherry-tree grew outside, so close that its boughs tapped against the
      house, and it was so thick-set with blossoms that hardly a leaf was to be seen.
      On both sides of the house was a big orchard, one of apple-trees and one of
      cherry-trees, also showered over with blossoms; and their grass was all
      sprinkled with dandelions. In the garden below were lilac-trees purple with
      flowers, and their dizzily sweet fragrance drifted up to the window on the
      morning wind.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Below the garden a green field lush with clover sloped down to the hollow where
      the brook ran and where scores of white birches grew, upspringing airily out of
      an undergrowth suggestive of delightful possibilities in ferns and mosses and
      woodsy things generally. Beyond it was a hill, green and feathery with spruce
      and fir; there was a gap in it where the gray gable end of the little house she
      had seen from the other side of the Lake of Shining Waters was visible.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Off to the left were the big barns and beyond them, away down over green,
      low-sloping fields, was a sparkling blue glimpse of sea.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Anne’s beauty-loving eyes lingered on it all, taking everything greedily
      in. She had looked on so many unlovely places in her life, poor child; but this
      was as lovely as anything she had ever dreamed.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      She knelt there, lost to everything but the loveliness around her, until she
      was startled by a hand on her shoulder. Marilla had come in unheard by the
      small dreamer.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “It’s time you were dressed,” she said curtly.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Marilla really did not know how to talk to the child, and her uncomfortable
      ignorance made her crisp and curt when she did not mean to be.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Anne stood up and drew a long breath.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Oh, isn’t it wonderful?” she said, waving her hand
      comprehensively at the good world outside.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “It’s a big tree,” said Marilla, “and it blooms great,
      but the fruit don’t amount to much never—small and wormy.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Oh, I don’t mean just the tree; of course it’s
      lovely—yes, it’s <i>radiantly</i> lovely—it blooms as if it
      meant it—but I meant everything, the garden and the orchard and the brook
      and the woods, the whole big dear world. Don’t you feel as if you just
      loved the world on a morning like this? And I can hear the brook laughing all
      the way up here. Have you ever noticed what cheerful things brooks are?
      They’re always laughing. Even in winter-time I’ve heard them under
      the ice. I’m so glad there’s a brook near Green Gables. Perhaps you
      think it doesn’t make any difference to me when you’re not going to
      keep me, but it does. I shall always like to remember that there is a brook at
      Green Gables even if I never see it again. If there wasn’t a brook
      I’d be <i>haunted</i> by the uncomfortable feeling that there ought to be
      one. I’m not in the depths of despair this morning. I never can be in the
      morning. Isn’t it a splendid thing that there are mornings? But I feel
      very sad. I’ve just been imagining that it was really me you wanted after
      all and that I was to stay here for ever and ever. It was a great comfort while
      it lasted. But the worst of imagining things is that the time comes when you
      have to stop and that hurts.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “You’d better get dressed and come down-stairs and never mind your
      imaginings,” said Marilla as soon as she could get a word in edgewise.
      “Breakfast is waiting. Wash your face and comb your hair. Leave the
      window up and turn your bedclothes back over the foot of the bed. Be as smart
      as you can.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Anne could evidently be smart to some purpose for she was down-stairs in ten
      minutes’ time, with her clothes neatly on, her hair brushed and braided,
      her face washed, and a comfortable consciousness pervading her soul that she
      had fulfilled all Marilla’s requirements. As a matter of fact, however,
      she had forgotten to turn back the bedclothes.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I’m pretty hungry this morning,” she announced as she
      slipped into the chair Marilla placed for her. “The world doesn’t
      seem such a howling wilderness as it did last night. I’m so glad
      it’s a sunshiny morning. But I like rainy mornings real well, too. All
      sorts of mornings are interesting, don’t you think? You don’t know
      what’s going to happen through the day, and there’s so much scope
      for imagination. But I’m glad it’s not rainy today because
      it’s easier to be cheerful and bear up under affliction on a sunshiny
      day. I feel that I have a good deal to bear up under. It’s all very well
      to read about sorrows and imagine yourself living through them heroically, but
      it’s not so nice when you really come to have them, is it?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “For pity’s sake hold your tongue,” said Marilla. “You
      talk entirely too much for a little girl.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Thereupon Anne held her tongue so obediently and thoroughly that her continued
      silence made Marilla rather nervous, as if in the presence of something not
      exactly natural. Matthew also held his tongue,—but this was
      natural,—so that the meal was a very silent one.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      As it progressed Anne became more and more abstracted, eating mechanically,
      with her big eyes fixed unswervingly and unseeingly on the sky outside the
      window. This made Marilla more nervous than ever; she had an uncomfortable
      feeling that while this odd child’s body might be there at the table her
      spirit was far away in some remote airy cloudland, borne aloft on the wings of
      imagination. Who would want such a child about the place?
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Yet Matthew wished to keep her, of all unaccountable things! Marilla felt that
      he wanted it just as much this morning as he had the night before, and that he
      would go on wanting it. That was Matthew’s way—take a whim into his
      head and cling to it with the most amazing silent persistency—a
      persistency ten times more potent and effectual in its very silence than if he
      had talked it out.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      When the meal was ended Anne came out of her reverie and offered to wash the
      dishes.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Can you wash dishes right?” asked Marilla distrustfully.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Pretty well. I’m better at looking after children, though.
      I’ve had so much experience at that. It’s such a pity you
      haven’t any here for me to look after.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I don’t feel as if I wanted any more children to look after than
      I’ve got at present. <i>You’re</i> problem enough in all
      conscience. What’s to be done with you I don’t know. Matthew is a
      most ridiculous man.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I think he’s lovely,” said Anne reproachfully. “He is
      so very sympathetic. He didn’t mind how much I talked—he seemed to
      like it. I felt that he was a kindred spirit as soon as ever I saw him.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “You’re both queer enough, if that’s what you mean by kindred
      spirits,” said Marilla with a sniff. “Yes, you may wash the dishes.
      Take plenty of hot water, and be sure you dry them well. I’ve got enough
      to attend to this morning for I’ll have to drive over to White Sands in
      the afternoon and see Mrs. Spencer. You’ll come with me and we’ll
      settle what’s to be done with you. After you’ve finished the dishes
      go up-stairs and make your bed.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Anne washed the dishes deftly enough, as Marilla, who kept a sharp eye on the
      process, discerned. Later on she made her bed less successfully, for she had
      never learned the art of wrestling with a feather tick. But it was done somehow
      and smoothed down; and then Marilla, to get rid of her, told her she might go
      out-of-doors and amuse herself until dinnertime.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Anne flew to the door, face alight, eyes glowing. On the very threshold she
      stopped short, wheeled about, came back and sat down by the table, light and
      glow as effectually blotted out as if some one had clapped an extinguisher on
      her.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “What’s the matter now?” demanded Marilla.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I don’t dare go out,” said Anne, in the tone of a martyr
      relinquishing all earthly joys. “If I can’t stay here there is no
      use in my loving Green Gables. And if I go out there and get acquainted with
      all those trees and flowers and the orchard and the brook I’ll not be
      able to help loving it. It’s hard enough now, so I won’t make it
      any harder. I want to go out so much—everything seems to be calling to
      me, ‘Anne, Anne, come out to us. Anne, Anne, we want a
      playmate’—but it’s better not. There is no use in loving
      things if you have to be torn from them, is there? And it’s so hard to
      keep from loving things, isn’t it? That was why I was so glad when I
      thought I was going to live here. I thought I’d have so many things to
      love and nothing to hinder me. But that brief dream is over. I am resigned to
      my fate now, so I don’t think I’ll go out for fear I’ll get
      unresigned again. What is the name of that geranium on the window-sill,
      please?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “That’s the apple-scented geranium.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Oh, I don’t mean that sort of a name. I mean just a name you gave
      it yourself. Didn’t you give it a name? May I give it one then? May I
      call it—let me see—Bonny would do—may I call it Bonny while
      I’m here? Oh, do let me!”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Goodness, I don’t care. But where on earth is the sense of naming
      a geranium?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Oh, I like things to have handles even if they are only geraniums. It
      makes them seem more like people. How do you know but that it hurts a
      geranium’s feelings just to be called a geranium and nothing else? You
      wouldn’t like to be called nothing but a woman all the time. Yes, I shall
      call it Bonny. I named that cherry-tree outside my bedroom window this morning.
      I called it Snow Queen because it was so white. Of course, it won’t
      always be in blossom, but one can imagine that it is, can’t one?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I never in all my life saw or heard anything to equal her,”
      muttered Marilla, beating a retreat down to the cellar after potatoes.
      “She <i>is</i> kind of interesting, as Matthew says. I can feel already that
      I’m wondering what on earth she’ll say next. She’ll be
      casting a spell over me, too. She’s cast it over Matthew. That look he
      gave me when he went out said everything he said or hinted last night over
      again. I wish he was like other men and would talk things out. A body could
      answer back then and argue him into reason. But what’s to be done with a
      man who just <i>looks?</i>”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Anne had relapsed into reverie, with her chin in her hands and her eyes on the
      sky, when Marilla returned from her cellar pilgrimage. There Marilla left her
      until the early dinner was on the table.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I suppose I can have the mare and buggy this afternoon, Matthew?”
      said Marilla.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Matthew nodded and looked wistfully at Anne. Marilla intercepted the look and
      said grimly:
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I’m going to drive over to White Sands and settle this thing.
      I’ll take Anne with me and Mrs. Spencer will probably make arrangements
      to send her back to Nova Scotia at once. I’ll set your tea out for you
      and I’ll be home in time to milk the cows.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Still Matthew said nothing and Marilla had a sense of having wasted words and
      breath. There is nothing more aggravating than a man who won’t talk
      back—unless it is a woman who won’t.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Matthew hitched the sorrel into the buggy in due time and Marilla and Anne set
      off. Matthew opened the yard gate for them and as they drove slowly through, he
      said, to nobody in particular as it seemed:
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Little Jerry Buote from the Creek was here this morning, and I told him
      I guessed I’d hire him for the summer.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Marilla made no reply, but she hit the unlucky sorrel such a vicious clip with
      the whip that the fat mare, unused to such treatment, whizzed indignantly down
      the lane at an alarming pace. Marilla looked back once as the buggy bounced
      along and saw that aggravating Matthew leaning over the gate, looking wistfully
      after them.

      CHAPTER V.<br>
      Anne’s History</h2>
    
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">D</span>O you know,” said
      Anne confidentially, “I’ve made up my mind to enjoy this drive.
      It’s been my experience that you can nearly always enjoy things if you
      make up your mind firmly that you will. Of course, you must make it up
      <i>firmly</i>. I am not going to think about going back to the asylum while
      we’re having our drive. I’m just going to think about the drive.
      Oh, look, there’s one little early wild rose out! Isn’t it lovely?
      Don’t you think it must be glad to be a rose? Wouldn’t it be nice
      if roses could talk? I’m sure they could tell us such lovely things. And
      isn’t pink the most bewitching color in the world? I love it, but I
      can’t wear it. Redheaded people can’t wear pink, not even in
      imagination. Did you ever know of anybody whose hair was red when she was
      young, but got to be another color when she grew up?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “No, I don’t know as I ever did,” said Marilla mercilessly,
      “and I shouldn’t think it likely to happen in your case
      either.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Anne sighed.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Well, that is another hope gone. ‘My life is a perfect graveyard
      of buried hopes.’ That’s a sentence I read in a book once, and I
      say it over to comfort myself whenever I’m disappointed in
      anything.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I don’t see where the comforting comes in myself,” said
      Marilla.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Why, because it sounds so nice and romantic, just as if I were a heroine
      in a book, you know. I am so fond of romantic things, and a graveyard full of
      buried hopes is about as romantic a thing as one can imagine, isn’t it?
      I’m rather glad I have one. Are we going across the Lake of Shining
      Waters today?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “We’re not going over Barry’s pond, if that’s what you
      mean by your Lake of Shining Waters. We’re going by the shore
      road.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Shore road sounds nice,” said Anne dreamily. “Is it as nice
      as it sounds? Just when you said ‘shore road’ I saw it in a picture
      in my mind, as quick as that! And White Sands is a pretty name, too; but I
      don’t like it as well as Avonlea. Avonlea is a lovely name. It just
      sounds like music. How far is it to White Sands?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “It’s five miles; and as you’re evidently bent on talking you
      might as well talk to some purpose by telling me what you know about
      yourself.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Oh, what I <i>know</i> about myself isn’t really worth
      telling,” said Anne eagerly. “If you’ll only let me tell you
      what I <i>imagine</i> about myself you’ll think it ever so much more
      interesting.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “No, I don’t want any of your imaginings. Just you stick to bald
      facts. Begin at the beginning. Where were you born and how old are you?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I was eleven last March,” said Anne, resigning herself to bald
      facts with a little sigh. “And I was born in Bolingbroke, Nova Scotia. My
      father’s name was Walter Shirley, and he was a teacher in the Bolingbroke
      High School. My mother’s name was Bertha Shirley. Aren’t Walter and
      Bertha lovely names? I’m so glad my parents had nice names. It would be a
      real disgrace to have a father named—well, say Jedediah, wouldn’t
      it?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I guess it doesn’t matter what a person’s name is as long as
      he behaves himself,” said Marilla, feeling herself called upon to
      inculcate a good and useful moral.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Well, I don’t know.” Anne looked thoughtful. “I read
      in a book once that a rose by any other name would smell as sweet, but
      I’ve never been able to believe it. I don’t believe a rose
      <i>would</i> be as nice if it was called a thistle or a skunk cabbage. I
      suppose my father could have been a good man even if he had been called
      Jedediah; but I’m sure it would have been a cross. Well, my mother was a
      teacher in the High School, too, but when she married father she gave up
      teaching, of course. A husband was enough responsibility. Mrs. Thomas said that
      they were a pair of babies and as poor as church mice. They went to live in a
      weeny-teeny little yellow house in Bolingbroke. I’ve never seen that
      house, but I’ve imagined it thousands of times. I think it must have had
      honeysuckle over the parlor window and lilacs in the front yard and lilies of
      the valley just inside the gate. Yes, and muslin curtains in all the windows.
      Muslin curtains give a house such an air. I was born in that house. Mrs. Thomas
      said I was the homeliest baby she ever saw, I was so scrawny and tiny and
      nothing but eyes, but that mother thought I was perfectly beautiful. I should
      think a mother would be a better judge than a poor woman who came in to scrub,
      wouldn’t you? I’m glad she was satisfied with me anyhow; I would
      feel so sad if I thought I was a disappointment to her—because she
      didn’t live very long after that, you see. She died of fever when I was
      just three months old. I do wish she’d lived long enough for me to
      remember calling her mother. I think it would be so sweet to say
      ‘mother,’ don’t you? And father died four days afterwards
      from fever too. That left me an orphan and folks were at their wits’ end,
      so Mrs. Thomas said, what to do with me. You see, nobody wanted me even then.
      It seems to be my fate. Father and mother had both come from places far away
      and it was well known they hadn’t any relatives living. Finally Mrs.
      Thomas said she’d take me, though she was poor and had a drunken husband.
      She brought me up by hand. Do you know if there is anything in being brought up
      by hand that ought to make people who are brought up that way better than other
      people? Because whenever I was naughty Mrs. Thomas would ask me how I could be
      such a bad girl when she had brought me up by hand—reproachful-like.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Mr. and Mrs. Thomas moved away from Bolingbroke to Marysville, and I
      lived with them until I was eight years old. I helped look after the Thomas
      children—there were four of them younger than me—and I can tell you
      they took a lot of looking after. Then Mr. Thomas was killed falling under a
      train and his mother offered to take Mrs. Thomas and the children, but she
      didn’t want me. Mrs. Thomas was at <i>her</i> wits’ end, so she
      said, what to do with me. Then Mrs. Hammond from up the river came down and
      said she’d take me, seeing I was handy with children, and I went up the
      river to live with her in a little clearing among the stumps. It was a very
      lonesome place. I’m sure I could never have lived there if I hadn’t
      had an imagination. Mr. Hammond worked a little sawmill up there, and Mrs.
      Hammond had eight children. She had twins three times. I like babies in
      moderation, but twins three times in succession is <i>too much</i>. I told Mrs.
      Hammond so firmly, when the last pair came. I used to get so dreadfully tired
      carrying them about.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I lived up river with Mrs. Hammond over two years, and then Mr. Hammond
      died and Mrs. Hammond broke up housekeeping. She divided her children among her
      relatives and went to the States. I had to go to the asylum at Hopeton, because
      nobody would take me. They didn’t want me at the asylum, either; they
      said they were overcrowded as it was. But they had to take me and I was there
      four months until Mrs. Spencer came.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Anne finished up with another sigh, of relief this time. Evidently she did not
      like talking about her experiences in a world that had not wanted her.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Did you ever go to school?” demanded Marilla, turning the sorrel
      mare down the shore road.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Not a great deal. I went a little the last year I stayed with Mrs.
      Thomas. When I went up river we were so far from a school that I couldn’t
      walk it in winter and there was vacation in summer, so I could only go in the
      spring and fall. But of course I went while I was at the asylum. I can read
      pretty well and I know ever so many pieces of poetry off by
      heart—‘The Battle of Hohenlinden’ and ‘Edinburgh after
      Flodden,’ and ‘Bingen on the Rhine,’ and lots of the
      ‘Lady of the Lake’ and most of ‘The Seasons,’ by James
      Thompson. Don’t you just love poetry that gives you a crinkly feeling up
      and down your back? There is a piece in the Fifth Reader—‘The
      Downfall of Poland’—that is just full of thrills. Of course, I
      wasn’t in the Fifth Reader—I was only in the Fourth—but the
      big girls used to lend me theirs to read.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Were those women—Mrs. Thomas and Mrs. Hammond—good to
      you?” asked Marilla, looking at Anne out of the corner of her eye.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “O-o-o-h,” faltered Anne. Her sensitive little face suddenly
      flushed scarlet and embarrassment sat on her brow. “Oh, they <i>meant</i>
      to be—I know they meant to be just as good and kind as possible. And when
      people mean to be good to you, you don’t mind very much when
      they’re not quite—always. They had a good deal to worry them, you
      know. It’s very trying to have a drunken husband, you see; and it must
      be very trying to have twins three times in succession, don’t you think?
      But I feel sure they meant to be good to me.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Marilla asked no more questions. Anne gave herself up to a silent rapture over
      the shore road and Marilla guided the sorrel abstractedly while she pondered
      deeply. Pity was suddenly stirring in her heart for the child. What a starved,
      unloved life she had had—a life of drudgery and poverty and neglect; for
      Marilla was shrewd enough to read between the lines of Anne’s history and
      divine the truth. No wonder she had been so delighted at the prospect of a real
      home. It was a pity she had to be sent back. What if she, Marilla, should
      indulge Matthew’s unaccountable whim and let her stay? He was set on it;
      and the child seemed a nice, teachable little thing.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “She’s got too much to say,” thought Marilla, “but she
      might be trained out of that. And there’s nothing rude or slangy in what
      she does say. She’s ladylike. It’s likely her people were nice
      folks.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The shore road was “woodsy and wild and lonesome.” On the right
      hand, scrub firs, their spirits quite unbroken by long years of tussle with the
      gulf winds, grew thickly. On the left were the steep red sandstone cliffs, so
      near the track in places that a mare of less steadiness than the sorrel might
      have tried the nerves of the people behind her. Down at the base of the cliffs
      were heaps of surf-worn rocks or little sandy coves inlaid with pebbles as with
      ocean jewels; beyond lay the sea, shimmering and blue, and over it soared the
      gulls, their pinions flashing silvery in the sunlight.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Isn’t the sea wonderful?” said Anne, rousing from a long,
      wide-eyed silence. “Once, when I lived in Marysville, Mr. Thomas hired an
      express wagon and took us all to spend the day at the shore ten miles away. I
      enjoyed every moment of that day, even if I had to look after the children all
      the time. I lived it over in happy dreams for years. But this shore is nicer
      than the Marysville shore. Aren’t those gulls splendid? Would you like to
      be a gull? I think I would—that is, if I couldn’t be a human girl.
      Don’t you think it would be nice to wake up at sunrise and swoop down
      over the water and away out over that lovely blue all day; and then at night to
      fly back to one’s nest? Oh, I can just imagine myself doing it. What big
      house is that just ahead, please?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “That’s the White Sands Hotel. Mr. Kirke runs it, but the season
      hasn’t begun yet. There are heaps of Americans come there for the summer.
      They think this shore is just about right.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I was afraid it might be Mrs. Spencer’s place,” said Anne
      mournfully. “I don’t want to get there. Somehow, it will seem like
      the end of everything.”

      CHAPTER VI.<br>
      Marilla Makes Up Her Mind</h2>
    
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">G</span>ET there they did,
      however, in due season. Mrs. Spencer lived in a big yellow house at White Sands
      Cove, and she came to the door with surprise and welcome mingled on her
      benevolent face.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Dear, dear,” she exclaimed, “you’re the last folks I
      was looking for today, but I’m real glad to see you. You’ll put
      your horse in? And how are you, Anne?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I’m as well as can be expected, thank you,” said Anne
      smilelessly. A blight seemed to have descended on her.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I suppose we’ll stay a little while to rest the mare,” said
      Marilla, “but I promised Matthew I’d be home early. The fact is,
      Mrs. Spencer, there’s been a queer mistake somewhere, and I’ve come
      over to see where it is. We sent word, Matthew and I, for you to bring us a boy
      from the asylum. We told your brother Robert to tell you we wanted a boy ten or
      eleven years old.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Marilla Cuthbert, you don’t say so!” said Mrs. Spencer in
      distress. “Why, Robert sent word down by his daughter Nancy and she said
      you wanted a girl—didn’t she, Flora Jane?” appealing to her
      daughter who had come out to the steps.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “She certainly did, Miss Cuthbert,” corroborated Flora Jane
      earnestly.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I’m dreadful sorry,” said Mrs. Spencer. “It’s
      too bad; but it certainly wasn’t my fault, you see, Miss Cuthbert. I did
      the best I could and I thought I was following your instructions. Nancy is a
      terrible flighty thing. I’ve often had to scold her well for her
      heedlessness.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “It was our own fault,” said Marilla resignedly. “We should
      have come to you ourselves and not left an important message to be passed along
      by word of mouth in that fashion. Anyhow, the mistake has been made and the
      only thing to do now is to set it right. Can we send the child back to the asylum?
      I suppose they’ll take her back, won’t they?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I suppose so,” said Mrs. Spencer thoughtfully, “but I
      don’t think it will be necessary to send her back. Mrs. Peter Blewett was
      up here yesterday, and she was saying to me how much she wished she’d
      sent by me for a little girl to help her. Mrs. Peter has a large family, you
      know, and she finds it hard to get help. Anne will be the very girl for her. I
      call it positively providential.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Marilla did not look as if she thought Providence had much to do with the
      matter. Here was an unexpectedly good chance to get this unwelcome orphan off
      her hands, and she did not even feel grateful for it.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      She knew Mrs. Peter Blewett only by sight as a small, shrewish-faced woman
      without an ounce of superfluous flesh on her bones. But she had heard of her.
      “A terrible worker and driver,” Mrs. Peter was said to be; and
      discharged servant girls told fearsome tales of her temper and stinginess, and
      her family of pert, quarrelsome children. Marilla felt a qualm of conscience at
      the thought of handing Anne over to her tender mercies.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Well, I’ll go in and we’ll talk the matter over,” she
      said.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “And if there isn’t Mrs. Peter coming up the lane this blessed
      minute!” exclaimed Mrs. Spencer, bustling her guests through the hall
      into the parlor, where a deadly chill struck on them as if the air had been
      strained so long through dark green, closely drawn blinds that it had lost
      every particle of warmth it had ever possessed. “That is real lucky, for
      we can settle the matter right away. Take the armchair, Miss Cuthbert. Anne,
      you sit here on the ottoman and don’t wriggle. Let me take your hats.
      Flora Jane, go out and put the kettle on. Good afternoon, Mrs. Blewett. We were
      just saying how fortunate it was you happened along. Let me introduce you two
      ladies. Mrs. Blewett, Miss Cuthbert. Please excuse me for just a moment. I
      forgot to tell Flora Jane to take the buns out of the oven.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Mrs. Spencer whisked away, after pulling up the blinds. Anne, sitting mutely on
      the ottoman, with her hands clasped tightly in her lap, stared at Mrs. Blewett
      as one fascinated. Was she to be given into the keeping of this sharp-faced,
      sharp-eyed woman? She felt a lump coming up in her throat and her eyes smarted
      painfully. She was beginning to be afraid she couldn’t keep the tears
      back when Mrs. Spencer returned, flushed and beaming, quite capable of taking
      any and every difficulty, physical, mental or spiritual, into consideration and
      settling it out of hand.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “It seems there’s been a mistake about this little girl, Mrs.
      Blewett,” she said. “I was under the impression that Mr. and Miss
      Cuthbert wanted a little girl to adopt. I was certainly told so. But it seems
      it was a boy they wanted. So if you’re still of the same mind you were
      yesterday, I think she’ll be just the thing for you.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Mrs. Blewett darted her eyes over Anne from head to foot.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “How old are you and what’s your name?” she demanded.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Anne Shirley,” faltered the shrinking child, not daring to make
      any stipulations regarding the spelling thereof, “and I’m eleven
      years old.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Humph! You don’t look as if there was much to you. But
      you’re wiry. I don’t know but the wiry ones are the best after all.
      Well, if I take you you’ll have to be a good girl, you know—good
      and smart and respectful. I’ll expect you to earn your keep, and no
      mistake about that. Yes, I suppose I might as well take her off your hands,
      Miss Cuthbert. The baby’s awful fractious, and I’m clean worn out
      attending to him. If you like I can take her right home now.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Marilla looked at Anne and softened at sight of the child’s pale face
      with its look of mute misery—the misery of a helpless little creature who
      finds itself once more caught in the trap from which it had escaped. Marilla
      felt an uncomfortable conviction that, if she denied the appeal of that look,
      it would haunt her to her dying day. Moreover, she did not fancy Mrs. Blewett.
      To hand a sensitive, “highstrung” child over to such a woman! No,
      she could not take the responsibility of doing that!
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Well, I don’t know,” she said slowly. “I didn’t
      say that Matthew and I had absolutely decided that we wouldn’t keep her.
      In fact, I may say that Matthew is disposed to keep her. I just came over to
      find out how the mistake had occurred. I think I’d better take her home
      again and talk it over with Matthew. I feel that I oughtn’t to decide on
      anything without consulting him. If we make up our mind not to keep her
      we’ll bring or send her over to you tomorrow night. If we don’t you
      may know that she is going to stay with us. Will that suit you, Mrs.
      Blewett?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I suppose it’ll have to,” said Mrs. Blewett ungraciously.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      During Marilla’s speech a sunrise had been dawning on Anne’s face.
      First the look of despair faded out; then came a faint flush of hope; her eyes
      grew deep and bright as morning stars. The child was quite transfigured; and, a
      moment later, when Mrs. Spencer and Mrs. Blewett went out in quest of a recipe
      the latter had come to borrow, she sprang up and flew across the room to
      Marilla.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Oh, Miss Cuthbert, did you really say that perhaps you would let me stay
      at Green Gables?” she said, in a breathless whisper, as if speaking aloud
      might shatter the glorious possibility. “Did you really say it? Or did I
      only imagine that you did?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I think you’d better learn to control that imagination of yours,
      Anne, if you can’t distinguish between what is real and what
      isn’t,” said Marilla crossly. “Yes, you did hear me say just
      that and no more. It isn’t decided yet and perhaps we will conclude to
      let Mrs. Blewett take you after all. She certainly needs you much more than I
      do.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I’d rather go back to the asylum than go to live with her,”
      said Anne passionately. “She looks exactly like a—like a
      gimlet.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Marilla smothered a smile under the conviction that Anne must be reproved for
      such a speech.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “A little girl like you should be ashamed of talking so about a lady and
      a stranger,” she said severely. “Go back and sit down quietly and
      hold your tongue and behave as a good girl should.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I’ll try to do and be anything you want me, if you’ll only
      keep me,” said Anne, returning meekly to her ottoman.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      When they arrived back at Green Gables that evening Matthew met them in the
      lane. Marilla from afar had noted him prowling along it and guessed his motive.
      She was prepared for the relief she read in his face when he saw that she had
      at least brought Anne back with her. But she said nothing, to him,
      relative to the affair, until they were both out in the yard behind the barn
      milking the cows. Then she briefly told him Anne’s history and the result
      of the interview with Mrs. Spencer.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I wouldn’t give a dog I liked to that Blewett woman,” said
      Matthew with unusual vim.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I don’t fancy her style myself,” admitted Marilla,
      “but it’s that or keeping her ourselves, Matthew. And, since you
      seem to want her, I suppose I’m willing—or have to be. I’ve
      been thinking over the idea until I’ve got kind of used to it. It seems a
      sort of duty. I’ve never brought up a child, especially a girl, and I
      dare say I’ll make a terrible mess of it. But I’ll do my best. So
      far as I’m concerned, Matthew, she may stay.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Matthew’s shy face was a glow of delight.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Well now, I reckoned you’d come to see it in that light,
      Marilla,” he said. “She’s such an interesting little
      thing.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “It’d be more to the point if you could say she was a useful little
      thing,” retorted Marilla, “but I’ll make it my business to
      see she’s trained to be that. And mind, Matthew, you’re not to go
      interfering with my methods. Perhaps an old maid doesn’t know much about
      bringing up a child, but I guess she knows more than an old bachelor. So you
      just leave me to manage her. When I fail it’ll be time enough to put your
      oar in.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “There, there, Marilla, you can have your own way,” said Matthew
      reassuringly. “Only be as good and kind to her as you can without
      spoiling her. I kind of think she’s one of the sort you can do anything
      with if you only get her to love you.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Marilla sniffed, to express her contempt for Matthew’s opinions
      concerning anything feminine, and walked off to the dairy with the pails.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I won’t tell her tonight that she can stay,” she reflected,
      as she strained the milk into the creamers. “She’d be so excited
      that she wouldn’t sleep a wink. Marilla Cuthbert, you’re fairly in
      for it. Did you ever suppose you’d see the day when you’d be
      adopting an orphan girl? It’s surprising enough; but not so surprising as
      that Matthew should be at the bottom of it, him that always seemed to have such
      a mortal dread of little girls. Anyhow, we’ve decided on the experiment
      and goodness only knows what will come of it.”

      CHAPTER VII.<br>
      Anne Says Her Prayers</h2>
    
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>HEN Marilla took Anne
      up to bed that night she said stiffly:
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Now, Anne, I noticed last night that you threw your clothes all about
      the floor when you took them off. That is a very untidy habit, and I
      can’t allow it at all. As soon as you take off any article of clothing
      fold it neatly and place it on the chair. I haven’t any use at all for
      little girls who aren’t neat.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I was so harrowed up in my mind last night that I didn’t think
      about my clothes at all,” said Anne. “I’ll fold them nicely
      tonight. They always made us do that at the asylum. Half the time, though,
      I’d forget, I’d be in such a hurry to get into bed nice and quiet
      and imagine things.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “You’ll have to remember a little better if you stay here,”
      admonished Marilla. “There, that looks something like. Say your prayers
      now and get into bed.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I never say any prayers,” announced Anne.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Marilla looked horrified astonishment.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Why, Anne, what do you mean? Were you never taught to say your prayers?
      God always wants little girls to say their prayers. Don’t you know who
      God is, Anne?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “‘God is a spirit, infinite, eternal and unchangeable, in His
      being, wisdom, power, holiness, justice, goodness, and truth,’”
      responded Anne promptly and glibly.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Marilla looked rather relieved.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “So you do know something then, thank goodness! You’re not quite a
      heathen. Where did you learn that?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Oh, at the asylum Sunday-school. They made us learn the whole catechism.
      I liked it pretty well. There’s something splendid about some of the
      words. ‘Infinite, eternal and unchangeable.’ Isn’t that
      grand? It has such a roll to it—just like a big organ playing. You
      couldn’t quite call it poetry, I suppose, but it sounds a lot like it,
      doesn’t it?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “We’re not talking about poetry, Anne—we are talking about
      saying your prayers. Don’t you know it’s a terrible wicked thing
      not to say your prayers every night? I’m afraid you are a very bad little
      girl.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “You’d find it easier to be bad than good if you had red
      hair,” said Anne reproachfully. “People who haven’t red hair
      don’t know what trouble is. Mrs. Thomas told me that God made my hair red
      <i>on purpose</i>, and I’ve never cared about Him since. And anyhow
      I’d always be too tired at night to bother saying prayers. People who
      have to look after twins can’t be expected to say their prayers. Now, do
      you honestly think they can?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Marilla decided that Anne’s religious training must be begun at once.
      Plainly there was no time to be lost.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “You must say your prayers while you are under my roof, Anne.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Why, of course, if you want me to,” assented Anne cheerfully.
      “I’d do anything to oblige you. But you’ll have to tell me
      what to say for this once. After I get into bed I’ll imagine out a real
      nice prayer to say always. I believe that it will be quite interesting, now
      that I come to think of it.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “You must kneel down,” said Marilla in embarrassment.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Anne knelt at Marilla’s knee and looked up gravely.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Why must people kneel down to pray? If I really wanted to pray
      I’ll tell you what I’d do. I’d go out into a great big field
      all alone or into the deep, deep woods, and I’d look up into the
      sky—up—up—up—into that lovely blue sky that looks as if
      there was no end to its blueness. And then I’d just <i>feel</i> a prayer.
      Well, I’m ready. What am I to say?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Marilla felt more embarrassed than ever. She had intended to teach Anne the
      childish classic, “Now I lay me down to sleep.” But she had, as I
      have told you, the glimmerings of a sense of humor—which is simply
      another name for a sense of the fitness of things; and it suddenly occurred to her
      that that simple little prayer, sacred to white-robed childhood lisping at
      motherly knees, was entirely unsuited to this freckled witch of a girl who knew
      and cared nothing about God’s love, since she had never had it translated
      to her through the medium of human love.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “You’re old enough to pray for yourself, Anne,” she said
      finally. “Just thank God for your blessings and ask Him humbly for the
      things you want.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Well, I’ll do my best,” promised Anne, burying her face in
      Marilla’s lap. “Gracious heavenly Father—that’s the way
      the ministers say it in church, so I suppose it’s all right in private
      prayer, isn’t it?” she interjected, lifting her head for a moment.
      “Gracious heavenly Father, I thank Thee for the White Way of Delight and
      the Lake of Shining Waters and Bonny and the Snow Queen. I’m really
      extremely grateful for them. And that’s all the blessings I can think of
      just now to thank Thee for. As for the things I want, they’re so numerous
      that it would take a great deal of time to name them all, so I will only mention
      the two most important. Please let me stay at Green Gables; and please let me
      be good-looking when I grow up. I remain,
    </p>
    
    <p class="right">
      “Yours respectfully,<br>
      Anne Shirley.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “There, did I do all right?” she asked eagerly, getting up.
      “I could have made it much more flowery if I’d had a little more
      time to think it over.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Poor Marilla was only preserved from complete collapse by remembering that it
      was not irreverence, but simply spiritual ignorance on the part of Anne that
      was responsible for this extraordinary petition. She tucked the child up in
      bed, mentally vowing that she should be taught a prayer the very next day, and
      was leaving the room with the light when Anne called her back.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I’ve just thought of it now. I should have said
      ‘Amen’ in place of ‘yours respectfully,’
      shouldn’t I?—the way the ministers do. I’d forgotten it, but
      I felt a prayer should be finished off in some way, so I put in the other. Do
      you suppose it will make any difference?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I—I don’t suppose it will,” said Marilla. “Go to
      sleep now like a good child. Good night.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I can say good night tonight with a clear conscience,” said
      Anne, cuddling luxuriously down among her pillows.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Marilla retreated to the kitchen, set the candle firmly on the table, and
      glared at Matthew.

      “Matthew Cuthbert, it’s about time somebody adopted that child and
      taught her something. She’s next door to a perfect heathen. Will you
      believe that she never said a prayer in her life till tonight? I’ll send
      to the manse tomorrow and borrow the Peep of the Day series, that’s
      what I’ll do. And she shall go to Sunday-school just as soon as I can get
      some suitable clothes made for her. I foresee that I shall have my hands full.
      Well, well, we can’t get through this world without our share of trouble.
      I’ve had a pretty easy life of it so far, but my time has come at last
      and I suppose I’ll just have to make the best of it.”

      CHAPTER VIII.<br>
      Anne’s Bringing-up Is Begun</h2>
    
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">F</span>OR reasons best known
      to herself, Marilla did not tell Anne that she was to stay at Green Gables
      until the next afternoon. During the forenoon she kept the child busy with
      various tasks and watched over her with a keen eye while she did them. By noon
      she had concluded that Anne was smart and obedient, willing to work and quick
      to learn; her most serious shortcoming seemed to be a tendency to fall into
      daydreams in the middle of a task and forget all about it until such time as
      she was sharply recalled to earth by a reprimand or a catastrophe.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      When Anne had finished washing the dinner dishes she suddenly confronted
      Marilla with the air and expression of one desperately determined to learn the
      worst. Her thin little body trembled from head to foot; her face flushed and
      her eyes dilated until they were almost black; she clasped her hands tightly
      and said in an imploring voice:
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Oh, please, Miss Cuthbert, won’t you tell me if you are going to
      send me away or not? I’ve tried to be patient all the morning, but I
      really feel that I cannot bear not knowing any longer. It’s a dreadful
      feeling. Please tell me.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “You haven’t scalded the dishcloth in clean hot water as I told you
      to do,” said Marilla immovably. “Just go and do it before you ask
      any more questions, Anne.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Anne went and attended to the dishcloth. Then she returned to Marilla and
      fastened imploring eyes of the latter’s face.
    </p>
    
    <p>“Well,” said
      Marilla, unable to find any excuse for deferring her explanation longer,
      “I suppose I might as well tell you. Matthew and I have decided to keep
      you—that is, if you will try to be a good little girl and show yourself
      grateful. Why, child, whatever is the matter?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I’m crying,” said Anne in a tone of bewilderment. “I
      can’t think why. I’m glad as glad can be. Oh, <i>glad</i>
      doesn’t seem the right word at all. I was glad about the White Way and
      the cherry blossoms—but this! Oh, it’s something more than glad.
      I’m so happy. I’ll try to be so good. It will be uphill work, I
      expect, for Mrs. Thomas often told me I was desperately wicked. However,
      I’ll do my very best. But can you tell me why I’m crying?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I suppose it’s because you’re all excited and worked
      up,” said Marilla disapprovingly. “Sit down on that chair and try
      to calm yourself. I’m afraid you both cry and laugh far too easily. Yes,
      you can stay here and we will try to do right by you. You must go to school;
      but it’s only a fortnight till vacation so it isn’t worth while for
      you to start before it opens again in September.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “What am I to call you?” asked Anne. “Shall I always say Miss
      Cuthbert? Can I call you Aunt Marilla?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “No; you’ll call me just plain Marilla. I’m not used to being
      called Miss Cuthbert and it would make me nervous.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “It sounds awfully disrespectful to just say Marilla,” protested
      Anne.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I guess there’ll be nothing disrespectful in it if you’re
      careful to speak respectfully. Everybody, young and old, in Avonlea calls me
      Marilla except the minister. He says Miss Cuthbert—when he thinks of
      it.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I’d love to call you Aunt Marilla,” said Anne wistfully.
      “I’ve never had an aunt or any relation at all—not even a
      grandmother. It would make me feel as if I really belonged to you. Can’t
      I call you Aunt Marilla?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “No. I’m not your aunt and I don’t believe in calling people
      names that don’t belong to them.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “But we could imagine you were my aunt.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I couldn’t,” said Marilla grimly.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Do you never imagine things different from what they really are?”
      asked Anne wide-eyed.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “No.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Oh!” Anne drew a long breath. “Oh, Miss—Marilla, how
      much you miss!”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I don’t believe in imagining things different from what they
      really are,” retorted Marilla. “When the Lord puts us in certain
      circumstances He doesn’t mean for us to imagine them away. And that
      reminds me. Go into the sitting room, Anne—be sure your feet are clean
      and don’t let any flies in—and bring me out the illustrated card
      that’s on the mantelpiece. The Lord’s Prayer is on it and
      you’ll devote your spare time this afternoon to learning it off by heart.
      There’s to be no more of such praying as I heard last night.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I suppose I was very awkward,” said Anne apologetically,
      “but then, you see, I’d never had any practice. You couldn’t
      really expect a person to pray very well the first time she tried, could you? I
      thought out a splendid prayer after I went to bed, just as I promised you I
      would. It was nearly as long as a minister’s and so poetical. But would
      you believe it? I couldn’t remember one word when I woke up this morning.
      And I’m afraid I’ll never be able to think out another one as good.
      Somehow, things never are so good when they’re thought out a second time.
      Have you ever noticed that?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Here is something for you to notice, Anne. When I tell you to do a thing
      I want you to obey me at once and not stand stock-still and discourse about it.
      Just you go and do as I bid you.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Anne promptly departed for the sitting-room across the hall; she failed to
      return; after waiting ten minutes Marilla laid down her knitting and marched
      after her with a grim expression. She found Anne standing motionless before a
      picture hanging on the wall between the two windows, with her eyes astar with
      dreams. The white and green light strained through apple-trees and clustering
      vines outside fell over the rapt little figure with a half-unearthly radiance.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Anne, whatever are you thinking of?” demanded Marilla sharply.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Anne came back to earth with a start.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “That,” she said, pointing to the picture—a rather vivid
      chromo entitled, “Christ Blessing Little Children”—“and
      I was just imagining I was one of them—that I was the little girl in the
      blue dress, standing off by herself in the corner as if she didn’t belong
      to anybody, like me. She looks lonely and sad, don’t you think? I guess
      she hadn’t any father or mother of her own. But she wanted to be blessed,
      too, so she just crept shyly up on the outside of the crowd, hoping nobody
      would notice her—except Him. I’m sure I know just how she felt. Her
      heart must have beat and her hands must have got cold, like mine did when I
      asked you if I could stay. She was afraid He mightn’t notice her. But
      it’s likely He did, don’t you think? I’ve been trying to
      imagine it all out—her edging a little nearer all the time until she was
      quite close to Him; and then He would look at her and put His hand on her hair
      and oh, such a thrill of joy as would run over her! But I wish the artist
      hadn’t painted Him so sorrowful-looking. All His pictures are like that,
      if you’ve noticed. But I don’t believe He could really have looked
      so sad or the children would have been afraid of Him.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Anne,” said Marilla, wondering why she had not broken into this
      speech long before, “you shouldn’t talk that way. It’s
      irreverent—positively irreverent.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Anne’s eyes marveled.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Why, I felt just as reverent as could be. I’m sure I didn’t
      mean to be irreverent.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Well, I don’t suppose you did—but it doesn’t sound
      right to talk so familiarly about such things. And another thing, Anne, when I
      send you after something you’re to bring it at once and not fall into
      mooning and imagining before pictures. Remember that. Take that card and come
      right to the kitchen. Now, sit down in the corner and learn that prayer off by
      heart.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Anne set the card up against the jugful of apple blossoms she had brought in to
      decorate the dinner table—Marilla had eyed that decoration askance, but
      had said nothing—propped her chin on her hands, and fell to studying it
      intently for several silent minutes.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I like this,” she announced at length. “It’s
      beautiful. I’ve heard it before—I heard the superintendent of the
      asylum Sunday-school say it over once. But I didn’t like it then. He had
      such a cracked voice and he prayed it so mournfully. I really felt sure he
      thought praying was a disagreeable duty. This isn’t poetry, but it makes
      me feel just the same way poetry does. ‘Our Father who art in heaven,
      hallowed be Thy name.’ That is just like a line of music. Oh, I’m
      so glad you thought of making me learn this, Miss—Marilla.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Well, learn it and hold your tongue,” said Marilla shortly.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Anne tipped the vase of apple blossoms near enough to bestow a soft kiss on a
      pink-cupped bud, and then studied diligently for some moments longer.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Marilla,” she demanded presently, “do you think that I shall
      ever have a bosom friend in Avonlea?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “A—a what kind of friend?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “A bosom friend—an intimate friend, you know—a really kindred
      spirit to whom I can confide my inmost soul. I’ve dreamed of meeting her
      all my life. I never really supposed I would, but so many of my loveliest
      dreams have come true all at once that perhaps this one will, too. Do you think
      it’s possible?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Diana Barry lives over at Orchard Slope and she’s about your age.
      She’s a very nice little girl, and perhaps she will be a playmate for you
      when she comes home. She’s visiting her aunt over at Carmody just now.
      You’ll have to be careful how you behave yourself, though. Mrs. Barry is
      a very particular woman. She won’t let Diana play with any little girl
      who isn’t nice and good.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Anne looked at Marilla through the apple blossoms, her eyes aglow with
      interest.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “What is Diana like? Her hair isn’t red, is it? Oh, I hope not.
      It’s bad enough to have red hair myself, but I positively couldn’t
      endure it in a bosom friend.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Diana is a very pretty little girl. She has black eyes and hair and rosy
      cheeks. And she is good and smart, which is better than being pretty.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Marilla was as fond of morals as the Duchess in Wonderland, and was firmly
      convinced that one should be tacked on to every remark made to a child who was
      being brought up.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      But Anne waved the moral inconsequently aside and seized only on the delightful
      possibilities before it.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Oh, I’m so glad she’s pretty. Next to being beautiful
      oneself—and that’s impossible in my case—it would be best to
      have a beautiful bosom friend. When I lived with Mrs. Thomas she had a bookcase
      in her sitting room with glass doors. There weren’t any books in it; Mrs.
      Thomas kept her best china and her preserves there—when she had any
      preserves to keep. One of the doors was broken. Mr. Thomas smashed it one night
      when he was slightly intoxicated. But the other was whole and I used to pretend
      that my reflection in it was another little girl who lived in it. I called her
      Katie Maurice, and we were very intimate. I used to talk to her by the hour,
      especially on Sunday, and tell her everything. Katie was the comfort and
      consolation of my life. We used to pretend that the bookcase was enchanted and
      that if I only knew the spell I could open the door and step right into the
      room where Katie Maurice lived, instead of into Mrs. Thomas’ shelves of
      preserves and china. And then Katie Maurice would have taken me by the hand and
      led me out into a wonderful place, all flowers and sunshine and fairies, and we
      would have lived there happy for ever after. When I went to live with Mrs.
      Hammond it just broke my heart to leave Katie Maurice. She felt it dreadfully,
      too, I know she did, for she was crying when she kissed me good-bye through the
      bookcase door. There was no bookcase at Mrs. Hammond’s. But just up the
      river a little way from the house there was a long green little valley, and the
      loveliest echo lived there. It echoed back every word you said, even if you
      didn’t talk a bit loud. So I imagined that it was a little girl called
      Violetta and we were great friends and I loved her almost as well as I loved
      Katie Maurice—not quite, but almost, you know. The night before I went to
      the asylum I said good-bye to Violetta, and oh, her good-bye came back to me in
      such sad, sad tones. I had become so attached to her that I hadn’t the
      heart to imagine a bosom friend at the asylum, even if there had been any scope
      for imagination there.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I think it’s just as well there wasn’t,” said Marilla
      drily. “I don’t approve of such goings-on. You seem to half believe
      your own imaginations. It will be well for you to have a real live friend to
      put such nonsense out of your head. But don’t let Mrs. Barry hear you
      talking about your Katie Maurices and your Violettas or she’ll think you
      tell stories.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Oh, I won’t. I couldn’t talk of them to
      everybody—their memories are too sacred for that. But I thought I’d
      like to have you know about them. Oh, look, here’s a big bee just tumbled
      out of an apple blossom. Just think what a lovely place to live—in an
      apple blossom! Fancy going to sleep in it when the wind was rocking it. If I
      wasn’t a human girl I think I’d like to be a bee and live among the
      flowers.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Yesterday you wanted to be a sea-gull,” sniffed Marilla. “I
      think you are very fickle minded. I told you to learn that prayer and not talk.
      But it seems impossible for you to stop talking if you’ve got anybody
      that will listen to you. So go up to your room and learn it.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Oh, I know it pretty nearly all now—all but just the last
      line.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Well, never mind, do as I tell you. Go to your room and finish learning
      it well, and stay there until I call you down to help me get tea.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Can I take the apple blossoms with me for company?” pleaded Anne.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “No; you don’t want your room cluttered up with flowers. You should
      have left them on the tree in the first place.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I did feel a little that way, too,” said Anne. “I kind of
      felt I shouldn’t shorten their lovely lives by picking them—I
      wouldn’t want to be picked if I were an apple blossom. But the temptation
      was <i>irresistible</i>. What do you do when you meet with an irresistible
      temptation?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Anne, did you hear me tell you to go to your room?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Anne sighed, retreated to the east gable, and sat down in a chair by the
      window.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “There—I know this prayer. I learned that last sentence coming
      upstairs. Now I’m going to imagine things into this room so that
      they’ll always stay imagined. The floor is covered with a white velvet
      carpet with pink roses all over it and there are pink silk curtains at the
      windows. The walls are hung with gold and silver brocade tapestry. The
      furniture is mahogany. I never saw any mahogany, but it does sound <i>so</i>
      luxurious. This is a couch all heaped with gorgeous silken cushions, pink and
      blue and crimson and gold, and I am reclining gracefully on it. I can see my
      reflection in that splendid big mirror hanging on the wall. I am tall and
      regal, clad in a gown of trailing white lace, with a pearl cross on my breast
      and pearls in my hair. My hair is of midnight darkness and my skin is a clear
      ivory pallor. My name is the Lady Cordelia Fitzgerald. No, it
      isn’t—I can’t make <i>that</i> seem real.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      She danced up to the little looking-glass and peered into it. Her pointed
      freckled face and solemn gray eyes peered back at her.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “You’re only Anne of Green Gables,” she said earnestly,
      “and I see you, just as you are looking now, whenever I try to imagine
      I’m the Lady Cordelia. But it’s a million times nicer to be Anne of
      Green Gables than Anne of nowhere in particular, isn’t it?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      She bent forward, kissed her reflection affectionately, and betook herself to
      the open window.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Dear Snow Queen, good afternoon. And good afternoon, dear birches down in
      the hollow. And good afternoon, dear gray house up on the hill. I wonder if
      Diana is to be my bosom friend. I hope she will, and I shall love her very
      much. But I must never quite forget Katie Maurice and Violetta. They would feel
      so hurt if I did and I’d hate to hurt anybody’s feelings, even a
      little bookcase girl’s or a little echo girl’s. I must be careful
      to remember them and send them a kiss every day.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Anne blew a couple of airy kisses from her fingertips past the cherry blossoms
      and then, with her chin in her hands, drifted luxuriously out on a sea of
      daydreams.

      CHAPTER IX.<br>
      Mrs. Rachel Lynde Is Properly Horrified</h2>
    
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>NNE had been a
      fortnight at Green Gables before Mrs. Lynde arrived to inspect her. Mrs.
      Rachel, to do her justice, was not to blame for this. A severe and unseasonable
      attack of grippe had confined that good lady to her house ever since the
      occasion of her last visit to Green Gables. Mrs. Rachel was not often sick and
      had a well-defined contempt for people who were; but grippe, she asserted, was
      like no other illness on earth and could only be interpreted as one of the
      special visitations of Providence. As soon as her doctor allowed her to put her
      foot out-of-doors she hurried up to Green Gables, bursting with curiosity to
      see Matthew and Marilla’s orphan, concerning whom all sorts of stories
      and suppositions had gone abroad in Avonlea.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Anne had made good use of every waking moment of that fortnight. Already she
      was acquainted with every tree and shrub about the place. She had discovered
      that a lane opened out below the apple orchard and ran up through a belt of
      woodland; and she had explored it to its furthest end in all its delicious
      vagaries of brook and bridge, fir coppice and wild cherry arch, corners thick
      with fern, and branching byways of maple and mountain ash.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      She had made friends with the spring down in the hollow—that wonderful
      deep, clear icy-cold spring; it was set about with smooth red sandstones and
      rimmed in by great palm-like clumps of water fern; and beyond it was a log
      bridge over the brook.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      That bridge led Anne’s dancing feet up over a wooded hill beyond, where
      perpetual twilight reigned under the straight, thick-growing firs and spruces;
      the only flowers there were myriads of delicate “June bells,” those
      shyest and sweetest of woodland blooms, and a few pale, aerial starflowers,
      like the spirits of last year’s blossoms. Gossamers glimmered like
      threads of silver among the trees and the fir boughs and tassels seemed to
      utter friendly speech.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      All these raptured voyages of exploration were made in the odd half hours which
      she was allowed for play, and Anne talked Matthew and Marilla half-deaf over
      her discoveries. Not that Matthew complained, to be sure; he listened to it all
      with a wordless smile of enjoyment on his face; Marilla permitted the
      “chatter” until she found herself becoming too interested in it,
      whereupon she always promptly quenched Anne by a curt command to hold her
      tongue.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Anne was out in the orchard when Mrs. Rachel came, wandering at her own sweet
      will through the lush, tremulous grasses splashed with ruddy evening sunshine;
      so that good lady had an excellent chance to talk her illness fully over,
      describing every ache and pulse beat with such evident enjoyment that Marilla
      thought even grippe must bring its compensations. When details were exhausted
      Mrs. Rachel introduced the real reason of her call.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I’ve been hearing some surprising things about you and
      Matthew.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I don’t suppose you are any more surprised than I am
      myself,” said Marilla. “I’m getting over my surprise
      now.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “It was too bad there was such a mistake,” said Mrs. Rachel
      sympathetically. “Couldn’t you have sent her back?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I suppose we could, but we decided not to. Matthew took a fancy to her.
      And I must say I like her myself—although I admit she has her faults. The
      house seems a different place already. She’s a real bright little
      thing.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Marilla said more than she had intended to say when she began, for she read
      disapproval in Mrs. Rachel’s expression.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “It’s a great responsibility you’ve taken on yourself,”
      said that lady gloomily, “especially when you’ve never had any
      experience with children. You don’t know much about her or her real
      disposition, I suppose, and there’s no guessing how a child like that
      will turn out. But I don’t want to discourage you I’m sure,
      Marilla.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I’m not feeling discouraged,” was Marilla’s dry
      response, “when I make up my mind to do a thing it stays made up. I
      suppose you’d like to see Anne. I’ll call her in.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Anne came running in presently, her face sparkling with the delight of her
      orchard rovings; but, abashed at finding the delight herself in the unexpected
      presence of a stranger, she halted confusedly inside the door. She certainly
      was an odd-looking little creature in the short tight wincey dress she had worn
      from the asylum, below which her thin legs seemed ungracefully long. Her
      freckles were more numerous and obtrusive than ever; the wind had ruffled her
      hatless hair into over-brilliant disorder; it had never looked redder than at
      that moment.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Well, they didn’t pick you for your looks, that’s sure and
      certain,” was Mrs. Rachel Lynde’s emphatic comment. Mrs. Rachel was
      one of those delightful and popular people who pride themselves on speaking
      their mind without fear or favor. “She’s terrible skinny and
      homely, Marilla. Come here, child, and let me have a look at you. Lawful heart,
      did any one ever see such freckles? And hair as red as carrots! Come here,
      child, I say.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Anne “came there,” but not exactly as Mrs. Rachel expected. With
      one bound she crossed the kitchen floor and stood before Mrs. Rachel, her face
      scarlet with anger, her lips quivering, and her whole slender form trembling
      from head to foot.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I hate you,” she cried in a choked voice, stamping her foot on the
      floor. “I hate you—I hate you—I hate you—” a
      louder stamp with each assertion of hatred. “How dare you call me skinny
      and ugly? How dare you say I’m freckled and redheaded? You are a rude,
      impolite, unfeeling woman!”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Anne!” exclaimed Marilla in consternation.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      But Anne continued to face Mrs. Rachel undauntedly, head up, eyes blazing,
      hands clenched, passionate indignation exhaling from her like an atmosphere.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “How dare you say such things about me?” she repeated vehemently.
      “How would you like to have such things said about you? How would you
      like to be told that you are fat and clumsy and probably hadn’t a spark
      of imagination in you? I don’t care if I do hurt your feelings by saying
      so! I hope I hurt them. You have hurt mine worse than they were ever hurt
      before even by Mrs. Thomas’ intoxicated husband. And I’ll
      <i>never</i> forgive you for it, never, never!”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Stamp! Stamp!
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Did anybody ever see such a temper!” exclaimed the horrified Mrs.
      Rachel.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Anne go to your room and stay there until I come up,” said
      Marilla, recovering her powers of speech with difficulty.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Anne, bursting into tears, rushed to the hall door, slammed it until the tins
      on the porch wall outside rattled in sympathy, and fled through the hall and up
      the stairs like a whirlwind. A subdued slam above told that the door of the
      east gable had been shut with equal vehemence.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Well, I don’t envy you your job bringing <i>that</i> up,
      Marilla,” said Mrs. Rachel with unspeakable solemnity.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Marilla opened her lips to say she knew not what of apology or deprecation.
      What she did say was a surprise to herself then and ever afterwards.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “You shouldn’t have twitted her about her looks, Rachel.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Marilla Cuthbert, you don’t mean to say that you are upholding her
      in such a terrible display of temper as we’ve just seen?” demanded
      Mrs. Rachel indignantly.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “No,” said Marilla slowly, “I’m not trying to excuse
      her. She’s been very naughty and I’ll have to give her a talking to
      about it. But we must make allowances for her. She’s never been taught
      what is right. And you <i>were</i> too hard on her, Rachel.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Marilla could not help tacking on that last sentence, although she was again
      surprised at herself for doing it. Mrs. Rachel got up with an air of offended
      dignity.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Well, I see that I’ll have to be very careful what I say after
      this, Marilla, since the fine feelings of orphans, brought from goodness knows
      where, have to be considered before anything else. Oh, no, I’m not
      vexed—don’t worry yourself. I’m too sorry for you to leave
      any room for anger in my mind. You’ll have your own troubles with that
      child. But if you’ll take my advice—which I suppose you won’t
      do, although I’ve brought up ten children and buried
      two—you’ll do that ‘talking to’ you mention with a
      fair-sized birch switch. I should think <i>that</i> would be the most effective
      language for that kind of a child. Her temper matches her hair I guess. Well,
      good evening, Marilla. I hope you’ll come down to see me often as usual.
      But you can’t expect me to visit here again in a hurry, if I’m
      liable to be flown at and insulted in such a fashion. It’s something new
      in <i>my</i> experience.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Whereat Mrs. Rachel swept out and away—if a fat woman who always waddled
      <i>could</i> be said to sweep away—and Marilla with a very solemn face
      betook herself to the east gable.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      On the way upstairs she pondered uneasily as to what she ought to do. She felt
      no little dismay over the scene that had just been enacted. How unfortunate
      that Anne should have displayed such temper before Mrs. Rachel Lynde, of all
      people! Then Marilla suddenly became aware of an uncomfortable and rebuking
      consciousness that she felt more humiliation over this than sorrow over the
      discovery of such a serious defect in Anne’s disposition. And how was she
      to punish her? The amiable suggestion of the birch switch—to the
      efficiency of which all of Mrs. Rachel’s own children could have borne
      smarting testimony—did not appeal to Marilla. She did not believe she
      could whip a child. No, some other method of punishment must be found to bring
      Anne to a proper realization of the enormity of her offense.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Marilla found Anne face downward on her bed, crying bitterly, quite oblivious
      of muddy boots on a clean counterpane.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Anne,” she said not ungently.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      No answer.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Anne,” with greater severity, “get off that bed this minute
      and listen to what I have to say to you.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Anne squirmed off the bed and sat rigidly on a chair beside it, her face
      swollen and tear-stained and her eyes fixed stubbornly on the floor.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “This is a nice way for you to behave. Anne! Aren’t you ashamed of
      yourself?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “She hadn’t any right to call me ugly and redheaded,”
      retorted Anne, evasive and defiant.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “You hadn’t any right to fly into such a fury and talk the way you
      did to her, Anne. I was ashamed of you—thoroughly ashamed of you. I
      wanted you to behave nicely to Mrs. Lynde, and instead of that you have
      disgraced me. I’m sure I don’t know why you should lose your temper
      like that just because Mrs. Lynde said you were red-haired and homely. You say
      it yourself often enough.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Oh, but there’s such a difference between saying a thing yourself
      and hearing other people say it,” wailed Anne. “You may know a
      thing is so, but you can’t help hoping other people don’t quite
      think it is. I suppose you think I have an awful temper, but I couldn’t
      help it. When she said those things something just rose right up in me and
      choked me. I <i>had</i> to fly out at her.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Well, you made a fine exhibition of yourself I must say. Mrs. Lynde will
      have a nice story to tell about you everywhere—and she’ll tell it,
      too. It was a dreadful thing for you to lose your temper like that,
      Anne.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Just imagine how you would feel if somebody told you to your face that
      you were skinny and ugly,” pleaded Anne tearfully.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      An old remembrance suddenly rose up before Marilla. She had been a very small
      child when she had heard one aunt say of her to another, “What a pity she
      is such a dark, homely little thing.” Marilla was every day of fifty
      before the sting had gone out of that memory.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I don’t say that I think Mrs. Lynde was exactly right in saying
      what she did to you, Anne,” she admitted in a softer tone. “Rachel
      is too outspoken. But that is no excuse for such behavior on your part. She was
      a stranger and an elderly person and my visitor—all three very good
      reasons why you should have been respectful to her. You were rude and saucy
      and”—Marilla had a saving inspiration of
      punishment—“you must go to her and tell her you are very sorry for
      your bad temper and ask her to forgive you.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I can never do that,” said Anne determinedly and darkly.
      “You can punish me in any way you like, Marilla. You can shut me up in a
      dark, damp dungeon inhabited by snakes and toads and feed me only on bread and
      water and I shall not complain. But I cannot ask Mrs. Lynde to forgive
      me.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “We’re not in the habit of shutting people up in dark damp
      dungeons,” said Marilla drily, “especially as they’re rather
      scarce in Avonlea. But apologize to Mrs. Lynde you must and shall and
      you’ll stay here in your room until you can tell me you’re willing
      to do it.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I shall have to stay here forever then,” said Anne mournfully,
      “because I can’t tell Mrs. Lynde I’m sorry I said those
      things to her. How can I? I’m <i>not</i> sorry. I’m sorry
      I’ve vexed you; but I’m <i>glad</i> I told her just what I did. It
      was a great satisfaction. I can’t say I’m sorry when I’m not,
      can I? I can’t even <i>imagine</i> I’m sorry.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Perhaps your imagination will be in better working order by the
      morning,” said Marilla, rising to depart. “You’ll have the
      night to think over your conduct in and come to a better frame of mind. You
      said you would try to be a very good girl if we kept you at Green Gables, but I
      must say it hasn’t seemed very much like it this evening.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Leaving this Parthian shaft to rankle in Anne’s stormy bosom, Marilla
      descended to the kitchen, grievously troubled in mind and vexed in soul. She
      was as angry with herself as with Anne, because, whenever she recalled Mrs.
      Rachel’s dumbfounded countenance her lips twitched with amusement and she
      felt a most reprehensible desire to laugh.

      CHAPTER X.<br>
      Anne’s Apology</h2>
    
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>ARILLA said nothing to
      Matthew about the affair that evening; but when Anne proved still refractory
      the next morning an explanation had to be made to account for her absence from
      the breakfast table. Marilla told Matthew the whole story, taking pains to
      impress him with a due sense of the enormity of Anne’s behavior.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “It’s a good thing Rachel Lynde got a calling down; she’s a
      meddlesome old gossip,” was Matthew’s consolatory rejoinder.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Matthew Cuthbert, I’m astonished at you. You know that
      Anne’s behavior was dreadful, and yet you take her part! I suppose
      you’ll be saying next thing that she oughtn’t to be punished at
      all!”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Well now—no—not exactly,” said Matthew uneasily.
      “I reckon she ought to be punished a little. But don’t be too hard
      on her, Marilla. Recollect she hasn’t ever had anyone to teach her right.
      You’re—you’re going to give her something to eat,
      aren’t you?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “When did you ever hear of me starving people into good behavior?”
      demanded Marilla indignantly. “She’ll have her meals regular, and
      I’ll carry them up to her myself. But she’ll stay up there until
      she’s willing to apologize to Mrs. Lynde, and that’s final,
      Matthew.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Breakfast, dinner, and supper were very silent meals—for Anne still
      remained obdurate. After each meal Marilla carried a well-filled tray to the
      east gable and brought it down later on not noticeably depleted. Matthew eyed
      its last descent with a troubled eye. Had Anne eaten anything at all?
    </p>
    
    <p>
      When Marilla went out that evening to bring the cows from the back pasture,
      Matthew, who had been hanging about the barns and watching, slipped into the
      house with the air of a burglar and crept upstairs. As a general thing Matthew
      gravitated between the kitchen and the little bedroom off the hall where he
      slept; once in a while he ventured uncomfortably into the parlor or sitting
      room when the minister came to tea. But he had never been upstairs in his own
      house since the spring he helped Marilla paper the spare bedroom, and that was
      four years ago.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      He tiptoed along the hall and stood for several minutes outside the door of the
      east gable before he summoned courage to tap on it with his fingers and then
      open the door to peep in.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Anne was sitting on the yellow chair by the window gazing mournfully out into
      the garden. Very small and unhappy she looked, and Matthew’s heart smote
      him. He softly closed the door and tiptoed over to her.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Anne,” he whispered, as if afraid of being overheard, “how
      are you making it, Anne?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Anne smiled wanly.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Pretty well. I imagine a good deal, and that helps to pass the time. Of
      course, it’s rather lonesome. But then, I may as well get used to
      that.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Anne smiled again, bravely facing the long years of solitary imprisonment
      before her.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Matthew recollected that he must say what he had come to say without loss of
      time, lest Marilla return prematurely. “Well now, Anne, don’t you
      think you’d better do it and have it over with?” he whispered.
      “It’ll have to be done sooner or later, you know, for
      Marilla’s a dreadful determined woman—dreadful determined, Anne.
      Do it right off, I say, and have it over.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Do you mean apologize to Mrs. Lynde?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Yes—apologize—that’s the very word,” said
      Matthew eagerly. “Just smooth it over so to speak. That’s what I
      was trying to get at.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I suppose I could do it to oblige you,” said Anne thoughtfully.
      “It would be true enough to say I am sorry, because I <i>am</i> sorry
      now. I wasn’t a bit sorry last night. I was mad clear through, and I
      stayed mad all night. I know I did because I woke up three times and I was just
      furious every time. But this morning it was over. I wasn’t in a temper
      anymore—and it left a dreadful sort of goneness, too. I felt so ashamed
      of myself. But I just couldn’t think of going and telling Mrs. Lynde so.
      It would be so humiliating. I made up my mind I’d stay shut up here
      forever rather than do that. But still—I’d do anything for
      you—if you really want me to—”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Well now, of course I do. It’s terrible lonesome downstairs
      without you. Just go and smooth things over—that’s a good
      girl.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Very well,” said Anne resignedly. “I’ll tell Marilla
      as soon as she comes in I’ve repented.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “That’s right—that’s right, Anne. But don’t tell
      Marilla I said anything about it. She might think I was putting my oar in and I
      promised not to do that.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Wild horses won’t drag the secret from me,” promised Anne
      solemnly. “How would wild horses drag a secret from a person
      anyhow?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      But Matthew was gone, scared at his own success. He fled hastily to the
      remotest corner of the horse pasture lest Marilla should suspect what he had
      been up to. Marilla herself, upon her return to the house, was agreeably
      surprised to hear a plaintive voice calling, “Marilla” over the
      banisters.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Well?” she said, going into the hall.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I’m sorry I lost my temper and said rude things, and I’m
      willing to go and tell Mrs. Lynde so.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Very well.” Marilla’s crispness gave no sign of her relief.
      She had been wondering what under the canopy she should do if Anne did not give
      in. “I’ll take you down after milking.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Accordingly, after milking, behold Marilla and Anne walking down the lane, the
      former erect and triumphant, the latter drooping and dejected. But halfway down
      Anne’s dejection vanished as if by enchantment. She lifted her head and
      stepped lightly along, her eyes fixed on the sunset sky and an air of subdued
      exhilaration about her. Marilla beheld the change disapprovingly. This was no
      meek penitent such as it behooved her to take into the presence of the offended
      Mrs. Lynde.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “What are you thinking of, Anne?” she asked sharply.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I’m imagining out what I must say to Mrs. Lynde,” answered
      Anne dreamily.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      This was satisfactory—or should have been so. But Marilla could not rid
      herself of the notion that something in her scheme of punishment was going
      askew. Anne had no business to look so rapt and radiant.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Rapt and radiant Anne continued until they were in the very presence of Mrs.
      Lynde, who was sitting knitting by her kitchen window. Then the radiance
      vanished. Mournful penitence appeared on every feature. Before a word was
      spoken Anne suddenly went down on her knees before the astonished Mrs. Rachel
      and held out her hands beseechingly.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Oh, Mrs. Lynde, I am so extremely sorry,” she said with a quiver
      in her voice. “I could never express all my sorrow, no, not if I used up
      a whole dictionary. You must just imagine it. I behaved terribly to
      you—and I’ve disgraced the dear friends, Matthew and Marilla, who
      have let me stay at Green Gables although I’m not a boy. I’m a
      dreadfully wicked and ungrateful girl, and I deserve to be punished and cast
      out by respectable people forever. It was very wicked of me to fly into a
      temper because you told me the truth. It <i>was</i> the truth; every word you
      said was true. My hair is red and I’m freckled and skinny and ugly. What
      I said to you was true, too, but I shouldn’t have said it. Oh, Mrs.
      Lynde, please, please, forgive me. If you refuse it will be a lifelong sorrow
      on a poor little orphan girl, would you, even if she had a dreadful temper? Oh,
      I am sure you wouldn’t. Please say you forgive me, Mrs. Lynde.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Anne clasped her hands together, bowed her head, and waited for the word of
      judgment.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      There was no mistaking her sincerity—it breathed in every tone of her
      voice. Both Marilla and Mrs. Lynde recognized its unmistakable ring. But the
      former understood in dismay that Anne was actually enjoying her valley of
      humiliation—was reveling in the thoroughness of her abasement. Where was
      the wholesome punishment upon which she, Marilla, had plumed herself? Anne had
      turned it into a species of positive pleasure.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Good Mrs. Lynde, not being overburdened with perception, did not see this. She
      only perceived that Anne had made a very thorough apology and all resentment
      vanished from her kindly, if somewhat officious, heart.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “There, there, get up, child,” she said heartily. “Of course
      I forgive you. I guess I was a little too hard on you, anyway. But I’m
      such an outspoken person. You just mustn’t mind me, that’s what. It
      can’t be denied your hair is terrible red; but I knew a girl
      once—went to school with her, in fact—whose hair was every mite as
      red as yours when she was young, but when she grew up it darkened to a real
      handsome auburn. I wouldn’t be a mite surprised if yours did,
      too—not a mite.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Oh, Mrs. Lynde!” Anne drew a long breath as she rose to her feet.
      “You have given me a hope. I shall always feel that you are a benefactor.
      Oh, I could endure anything if I only thought my hair would be a handsome
      auburn when I grew up. It would be so much easier to be good if one’s
      hair was a handsome auburn, don’t you think? And now may I go out into
      your garden and sit on that bench under the apple-trees while you and Marilla
      are talking? There is so much more scope for imagination out there.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Laws, yes, run along, child. And you can pick a bouquet of them white
      June lilies over in the corner if you like.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      As the door closed behind Anne, Mrs. Lynde got briskly up to light a lamp.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “She’s a real odd little thing. Take this chair, Marilla;
      it’s easier than the one you’ve got; I just keep that for the hired
      boy to sit on. Yes, she certainly is an odd child, but there is something kind
      of taking about her after all. I don’t feel so surprised at you and
      Matthew keeping her as I did—nor so sorry for you, either. She may turn
      out all right. Of course, she has a queer way of expressing herself—a
      little too—well, too kind of forcible, you know; but she’ll likely
      get over that now that she’s come to live among civilized folks. And
      then, her temper’s pretty quick, I guess; but there’s one comfort,
      a child that has a quick temper, just blaze up and cool down, ain’t never
      likely to be sly or deceitful. Preserve me from a sly child, that’s what.
      On the whole, Marilla, I kind of like her.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      When Marilla went home Anne came out of the fragrant twilight of the orchard
      with a sheaf of white narcissi in her hands.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I apologized pretty well, didn’t I?” she said proudly as
      they went down the lane. “I thought since I had to do it I might as well
      do it thoroughly.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “You did it thoroughly, all right enough,” was Marilla’s
      comment. Marilla was dismayed at finding herself inclined to laugh over the
      recollection. She had also an uneasy feeling that she ought to scold Anne for
      apologizing so well; but then, that was ridiculous! She compromised with her
      conscience by saying severely:
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I hope you won’t have occasion to make many more such apologies. I
      hope you’ll try to control your temper now, Anne.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “That wouldn’t be so hard if people wouldn’t twit me about my
      looks,” said Anne with a sigh. “I don’t get cross about other
      things; but I’m <i>so</i> tired of being twitted about my hair and it
      just makes me boil right over. Do you suppose my hair will really be a handsome
      auburn when I grow up?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “You shouldn’t think so much about your looks, Anne. I’m
      afraid you are a very vain little girl.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “How can I be vain when I know I’m homely?” protested Anne.
      “I love pretty things; and I hate to look in the glass and see something
      that isn’t pretty. It makes me feel so sorrowful—just as I feel
      when I look at any ugly thing. I pity it because it isn’t
      beautiful.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Handsome is as handsome does,” quoted Marilla. “I’ve
      had that said to me before, but I have my doubts about it,” remarked
      skeptical Anne, sniffing at her narcissi. “Oh, aren’t these flowers
      sweet! It was lovely of Mrs. Lynde to give them to me. I have no hard feelings
      against Mrs. Lynde now. It gives you a lovely, comfortable feeling to apologize
      and be forgiven, doesn’t it? Aren’t the stars bright tonight? If
      you could live in a star, which one would you pick? I’d like that lovely
      clear big one away over there above that dark hill.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Anne, do hold your tongue,” said Marilla, thoroughly worn out
      trying to follow the gyrations of Anne’s thoughts.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Anne said no more until they turned into their own lane. A little gypsy wind
      came down it to meet them, laden with the spicy perfume of young dew-wet ferns.
      Far up in the shadows a cheerful light gleamed out through the trees from the
      kitchen at Green Gables. Anne suddenly came close to Marilla and slipped her
      hand into the older woman’s hard palm.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “It’s lovely to be going home and know it’s home,” she
      said. “I love Green Gables already, and I never loved any place before.
      No place ever seemed like home. Oh, Marilla, I’m so happy. I could pray
      right now and not find it a bit hard.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Something warm and pleasant welled up in Marilla’s heart at touch of that
      thin little hand in her own—a throb of the maternity she had missed,
      perhaps. Its very unaccustomedness and sweetness disturbed her. She hastened to
      restore her sensations to their normal calm by inculcating a moral.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “If you’ll be a good girl you’ll always be happy, Anne. And
      you should never find it hard to say your prayers.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Saying one’s prayers isn’t exactly the same thing as
      praying,” said Anne meditatively. “But I’m going to imagine
      that I’m the wind that is blowing up there in those tree tops. When I get
      tired of the trees I’ll imagine I’m gently waving down here in the
      ferns—and then I’ll fly over to Mrs. Lynde’s garden and set
      the flowers dancing—and then I’ll go with one great swoop over the
      clover field—and then I’ll blow over the Lake of Shining Waters and
      ripple it all up into little sparkling waves. Oh, there’s so much scope
      for imagination in a wind! So I’ll not talk any more just now,
      Marilla.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Thanks be to goodness for that,” breathed Marilla in devout
      relief.

      CHAPTER XI.<br>
      Anne’s Impressions of Sunday-school</h2>
    
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>ELL, how do you like
      them?” said Marilla.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Anne was standing in the gable room, looking solemnly at three new dresses
      spread out on the bed. One was of snuffy colored gingham which Marilla had been
      tempted to buy from a peddler the preceding summer because it looked so
      serviceable; one was of black-and-white checkered sateen which she had picked
      up at a bargain counter in the winter; and one was a stiff print of an ugly
      blue shade which she had purchased that week at a Carmody store.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      She had made them up herself, and they were all made alike—plain skirts
      fulled tightly to plain waists, with sleeves as plain as waist and skirt and
      tight as sleeves could be.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I’ll imagine that I like them,” said Anne soberly.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I don’t want you to imagine it,” said Marilla, offended.
      “Oh, I can see you don’t like the dresses! What is the matter with
      them? Aren’t they neat and clean and new?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Yes.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Then why don’t you like them?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “They’re—they’re not—pretty,” said Anne
      reluctantly.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Pretty!” Marilla sniffed. “I didn’t trouble my head
      about getting pretty dresses for you. I don’t believe in pampering
      vanity, Anne, I’ll tell you that right off. Those dresses are good,
      sensible, serviceable dresses, without any frills or furbelows about them, and
      they’re all you’ll get this summer. The brown gingham and the blue
      print will do you for school when you begin to go. The sateen is for church and
      Sunday-school. I’ll expect you to keep them neat and clean and not to
      tear them. I should think you’d be grateful to get most anything after
      those skimpy wincey things you’ve been wearing.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Oh, I <i>am</i> grateful,” protested Anne. “But I’d be
      ever so much gratefuller if—if you’d made just one of them with
      puffed sleeves. Puffed sleeves are so fashionable now. It would give me such a
      thrill, Marilla, just to wear a dress with puffed sleeves.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Well, you’ll have to do without your thrill. I hadn’t any
      material to waste on puffed sleeves. I think they are ridiculous-looking things
      anyhow. I prefer the plain, sensible ones.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “But I’d rather look ridiculous when everybody else does than plain
      and sensible all by myself,” persisted Anne mournfully.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Trust you for that! Well, hang those dresses carefully up in your
      closet, and then sit down and learn the Sunday-school lesson. I got a quarterly
      from Mr. Bell for you and you’ll go to Sunday-school tomorrow,”
      said Marilla, disappearing downstairs in high dudgeon.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Anne clasped her hands and looked at the dresses.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I did hope there would be a white one with puffed sleeves,” she
      whispered disconsolately. “I prayed for one, but I didn’t much
      expect it on that account. I didn’t suppose God would have time to bother
      about a little orphan girl’s dress. I knew I’d just have to depend
      on Marilla for it. Well, fortunately I can imagine that one of them is of
      snow-white muslin with lovely lace frills and three-puffed sleeves.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The next morning warnings of a sick headache prevented Marilla from going to
      Sunday-school with Anne.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “You’ll have to go down and call for Mrs. Lynde, Anne,” she
      said. “She’ll see that you get into the right class. Now, mind you
      behave yourself properly. Stay to preaching afterwards and ask Mrs. Lynde to
      show you our pew. Here’s a cent for collection. Don’t stare at
      people and don’t fidget. I shall expect you to tell me the text when you
      come home.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Anne started off irreproachable, arrayed in the stiff black-and-white sateen,
      which, while decent as regards length and certainly not open to the charge of
      skimpiness, contrived to emphasize every corner and angle of her thin figure.
      Her hat was a little, flat, glossy, new sailor, the extreme plainness of which
      had likewise much disappointed Anne, who had permitted herself secret visions
      of ribbon and flowers. The latter, however, were supplied before Anne reached
      the main road, for being confronted halfway down the lane with a golden frenzy
      of wind-stirred buttercups and a glory of wild roses, Anne promptly and
      liberally garlanded her hat with a heavy wreath of them. Whatever other people
      might have thought of the result it satisfied Anne, and she tripped gaily down
      the road, holding her ruddy head with its decoration of pink and yellow very
      proudly.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      When she had reached Mrs. Lynde’s house she found that lady gone. Nothing
      daunted, Anne proceeded onward to the church alone. In the porch she found a
      crowd of little girls, all more or less gaily attired in whites and blues and
      pinks, and all staring with curious eyes at this stranger in their midst, with
      her extraordinary head adornment. Avonlea little girls had already heard queer
      stories about Anne. Mrs. Lynde said she had an awful temper; Jerry Buote, the
      hired boy at Green Gables, said she talked all the time to herself or to the
      trees and flowers like a crazy girl. They looked at her and whispered to each
      other behind their quarterlies. Nobody made any friendly advances, then or
      later on when the opening exercises were over and Anne found herself in Miss
      Rogerson’s class.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Miss Rogerson was a middle-aged lady who had taught a Sunday-school class for
      twenty years. Her method of teaching was to ask the printed questions from the
      quarterly and look sternly over its edge at the particular little girl she
      thought ought to answer the question. She looked very often at Anne, and Anne,
      thanks to Marilla’s drilling, answered promptly; but it may be questioned
      if she understood very much about either question or answer.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      She did not think she liked Miss Rogerson, and she felt very miserable; every
      other little girl in the class had puffed sleeves. Anne felt that life was
      really not worth living without puffed sleeves.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Well, how did you like Sunday-school?” Marilla wanted to know when
      Anne came home. Her wreath having faded, Anne had discarded it in the lane, so
      Marilla was spared the knowledge of that for a time.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I didn’t like it a bit. It was horrid.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Anne Shirley!” said Marilla rebukingly.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Anne sat down on the rocker with a long sigh, kissed one of Bonny’s
      leaves, and waved her hand to a blossoming fuchsia.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “They might have been lonesome while I was away,” she explained.
      “And now about the Sunday-school. I behaved well, just as you told me.
      Mrs. Lynde was gone, but I went right on myself. I went into the church, with a
      lot of other little girls, and I sat in the corner of a pew by the window while
      the opening exercises went on. Mr. Bell made an awfully long prayer. I would
      have been dreadfully tired before he got through if I hadn’t been sitting
      by that window. But it looked right out on the Lake of Shining Waters, so I
      just gazed at that and imagined all sorts of splendid things.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “You shouldn’t have done anything of the sort. You should have
      listened to Mr. Bell.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “But he wasn’t talking to me,” protested Anne. “He was
      talking to God and he didn’t seem to be very much interested in it,
      either. I think he thought God was too far off though. There was a long row of
      white birches hanging over the lake and the sunshine fell down through them,
      ‘way, ‘way down, deep into the water. Oh, Marilla, it was like a
      beautiful dream! It gave me a thrill and I just said, ‘Thank you for it,
      God,’ two or three times.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Not out loud, I hope,” said Marilla anxiously.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Oh, no, just under my breath. Well, Mr. Bell did get through at last and
      they told me to go into the classroom with Miss Rogerson’s class. There
      were nine other girls in it. They all had puffed sleeves. I tried to imagine
      mine were puffed, too, but I couldn’t. Why couldn’t I? It was as
      easy as could be to imagine they were puffed when I was alone in the east
      gable, but it was awfully hard there among the others who had really truly
      puffs.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “You shouldn’t have been thinking about your sleeves in Sunday
      school. You should have been attending to the lesson. I hope you knew
      it.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Oh, yes; and I answered a lot of questions. Miss Rogerson asked ever so
      many. I don’t think it was fair for her to do all the asking. There were
      lots I wanted to ask her, but I didn’t like to because I didn’t
      think she was a kindred spirit. Then all the other little girls recited a
      paraphrase. She asked me if I knew any. I told her I didn’t, but I could
      recite, ‘The Dog at His Master’s Grave’ if she liked.
      That’s in the Third Royal Reader. It isn’t a really truly religious
      piece of poetry, but it’s so sad and melancholy that it might as well be.
      She said it wouldn’t do and she told me to learn the nineteenth
      paraphrase for next Sunday. I read it over in church afterwards and it’s
      splendid. There are two lines in particular that just thrill me.
    </p>
    
    <p class="poem">
      “‘Quick as the slaughtered squadrons fell<br>
      In Midian’s evil day.’
    </p>
    
    <p class="noindent">
      “I don’t know what ‘squadrons’ means nor
      ‘Midian,’ either, but it sounds <i>so</i> tragical. I can hardly
      wait until next Sunday to recite it. I’ll practice it all the week. After
      Sunday-school I asked Miss Rogerson—because Mrs. Lynde was too far
      away—to show me your pew. I sat just as still as I could and the text was
      Revelations, third chapter, second and third verses. It was a very long text.
      If I was a minister I’d pick the short, snappy ones. The sermon was
      awfully long, too. I suppose the minister had to match it to the text. I
      didn’t think he was a bit interesting. The trouble with him seems to be
      that he hasn’t enough imagination. I didn’t listen to him very
      much. I just let my thoughts run and I thought of the most surprising
      things.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Marilla felt helplessly that all this should be sternly reproved, but she was
      hampered by the undeniable fact that some of the things Anne had said,
      especially about the minister’s sermons and Mr. Bell’s prayers,
      were what she herself had really thought deep down in her heart for years, but
      had never given expression to. It almost seemed to her that those secret,
      unuttered, critical thoughts had suddenly taken visible and accusing shape and
      form in the person of this outspoken morsel of neglected humanity.

      CHAPTER XII.<br>
      A Solemn Vow and Promise</h2>
    
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>T was not until the
      next Friday that Marilla heard the story of the flower-wreathed hat. She came
      home from Mrs. Lynde’s and called Anne to account.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Anne, Mrs. Rachel says you went to church last Sunday with your hat
      rigged out ridiculous with roses and buttercups. What on earth put you up to
      such a caper? A pretty-looking object you must have been!”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Oh. I know pink and yellow aren’t becoming to me,” began
      Anne.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Becoming fiddlesticks! It was putting flowers on your hat at all, no
      matter what color they were, that was ridiculous. You are the most aggravating
      child!”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I don’t see why it’s any more ridiculous to wear flowers on
      your hat than on your dress,” protested Anne. “Lots of little girls
      there had bouquets pinned on their dresses. What’s the difference?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Marilla was not to be drawn from the safe concrete into dubious paths of the
      abstract.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Don’t answer me back like that, Anne. It was very silly of you to
      do such a thing. Never let me catch you at such a trick again. Mrs. Rachel says
      she thought she would sink through the floor when she saw you come in all
      rigged out like that. She couldn’t get near enough to tell you to take
      them off till it was too late. She says people talked about it something
      dreadful. Of course they would think I had no better sense than to let you go
      decked out like that.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Oh, I’m so sorry,” said Anne, tears welling into her eyes.
      “I never thought you’d mind. The roses and buttercups were so sweet
      and pretty I thought they’d look lovely on my hat. Lots of the little
      girls had artificial flowers on their hats. I’m afraid I’m going to
      be a dreadful trial to you. Maybe you’d better send me back to the
      asylum. That would be terrible; I don’t think I could endure it; most
      likely I would go into consumption; I’m so thin as it is, you see. But
      that would be better than being a trial to you.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Nonsense,” said Marilla, vexed at herself for having made the
      child cry. “I don’t want to send you back to the asylum, I’m
      sure. All I want is that you should behave like other little girls and not make
      yourself ridiculous. Don’t cry any more. I’ve got some news for
      you. Diana Barry came home this afternoon. I’m going up to see if I can
      borrow a skirt pattern from Mrs. Barry, and if you like you can come with me
      and get acquainted with Diana.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Anne rose to her feet, with clasped hands, the tears still glistening on her
      cheeks; the dish towel she had been hemming slipped unheeded to the floor.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Oh, Marilla, I’m frightened—now that it has come I’m
      actually frightened. What if she shouldn’t like me! It would be the most
      tragical disappointment of my life.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Now, don’t get into a fluster. And I do wish you wouldn’t
      use such long words. It sounds so funny in a little girl. I guess Diana
      ‘ll like you well enough. It’s her mother you’ve got to
      reckon with. If she doesn’t like you it won’t matter how much Diana
      does. If she has heard about your outburst to Mrs. Lynde and going to church
      with buttercups round your hat I don’t know what she’ll think of
      you. You must be polite and well behaved, and don’t make any of your
      startling speeches. For pity’s sake, if the child isn’t actually
      trembling!”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Anne <i>was</i> trembling. Her face was pale and tense.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Oh, Marilla, you’d be excited, too, if you were going to meet a
      little girl you hoped to be your bosom friend and whose mother mightn’t
      like you,” she said as she hastened to get her hat.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      They went over to Orchard Slope by the short cut across the brook and up the
      firry hill grove. Mrs. Barry came to the kitchen door in answer to
      Marilla’s knock. She was a tall black-eyed, black-haired woman, with a
      very resolute mouth. She had the reputation of being very strict with her
      children.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “How do you do, Marilla?” she said cordially. “Come in. And
      this is the little girl you have adopted, I suppose?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Yes, this is Anne Shirley,” said Marilla.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Spelled with an E,” gasped Anne, who, tremulous and excited as she
      was, was determined there should be no misunderstanding on that important
      point.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Mrs. Barry, not hearing or not comprehending, merely shook hands and said
      kindly:
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “How are you?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I am well in body although considerable rumpled up in spirit, thank you
      ma’am,” said Anne gravely. Then aside to Marilla in an audible
      whisper, “There wasn’t anything startling in that, was there,
      Marilla?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Diana was sitting on the sofa, reading a book which she dropped when the
      callers entered. She was a very pretty little girl, with her mother’s
      black eyes and hair, and rosy cheeks, and the merry expression which was her
      inheritance from her father.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “This is my little girl Diana,” said Mrs. Barry. “Diana, you
      might take Anne out into the garden and show her your flowers. It will be
      better for you than straining your eyes over that book. She reads entirely too
      much—” this to Marilla as the little girls went
      out—“and I can’t prevent her, for her father aids and abets
      her. She’s always poring over a book. I’m glad she has the prospect
      of a playmate—perhaps it will take her more out-of-doors.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Outside in the garden, which was full of mellow sunset light streaming through
      the dark old firs to the west of it, stood Anne and Diana, gazing bashfully at
      each other over a clump of gorgeous tiger lilies.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The Barry garden was a bowery wilderness of flowers which would have delighted
      Anne’s heart at any time less fraught with destiny. It was encircled by
      huge old willows and tall firs, beneath which flourished flowers that loved the
      shade. Prim, right-angled paths neatly bordered with clamshells, intersected it
      like moist red ribbons and in the beds between old-fashioned flowers ran riot.
      There were rosy bleeding-hearts and great splendid crimson peonies; white,
      fragrant narcissi and thorny, sweet Scotch roses; pink and blue and white
      columbines and lilac-tinted Bouncing Bets; clumps of southernwood and ribbon
      grass and mint; purple Adam-and-Eve, daffodils, and masses of sweet clover
      white with its delicate, fragrant, feathery sprays; scarlet lightning that shot
      its fiery lances over prim white musk-flowers; a garden it was where sunshine
      lingered and bees hummed, and winds, beguiled into loitering, purred and
      rustled.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Oh, Diana,” said Anne at last, clasping her hands and speaking
      almost in a whisper, “oh, do you think you can like me a
      little—enough to be my bosom friend?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Diana laughed. Diana always laughed before she spoke.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Why, I guess so,” she said frankly. “I’m awfully glad
      you’ve come to live at Green Gables. It will be jolly to have somebody to
      play with. There isn’t any other girl who lives near enough to play with,
      and I’ve no sisters big enough.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Will you swear to be my friend forever and ever?” demanded Anne
      eagerly.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Diana looked shocked.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Why it’s dreadfully wicked to swear,” she said rebukingly.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Oh no, not my kind of swearing. There are two kinds, you know.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I never heard of but one kind,” said Diana doubtfully.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “There really is another. Oh, it isn’t wicked at all. It just means
      vowing and promising solemnly.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Well, I don’t mind doing that,” agreed Diana, relieved.
      “How do you do it?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “We must join hands—so,” said Anne gravely. “It ought
      to be over running water. We’ll just imagine this path is running water.
      I’ll repeat the oath first. I solemnly swear to be faithful to my bosom
      friend, Diana Barry, as long as the sun and moon shall endure. Now you say it
      and put my name in.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Diana repeated the “oath” with a laugh fore and aft. Then she said:
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “You’re a queer girl, Anne. I heard before that you were queer. But
      I believe I’m going to like you real well.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      When Marilla and Anne went home Diana went with them as far as the log bridge.
      The two little girls walked with their arms about each other. At the brook they
      parted with many promises to spend the next afternoon together.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Well, did you find Diana a kindred spirit?” asked Marilla as they
      went up through the garden of Green Gables.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Oh yes,” sighed Anne, blissfully unconscious of any sarcasm on
      Marilla’s part. “Oh Marilla, I’m the happiest girl on Prince
      Edward Island this very moment. I assure you I’ll say my prayers with a
      right good-will tonight. Diana and I are going to build a playhouse in Mr.
      William Bell’s birch grove tomorrow. Can I have those broken pieces of
      china that are out in the woodshed? Diana’s birthday is in February and
      mine is in March. Don’t you think that is a very strange coincidence?
      Diana is going to lend me a book to read. She says it’s perfectly
      splendid and tremendously exciting. She’s going to show me a place back
      in the woods where rice lilies grow. Don’t you think Diana has got very
      soulful eyes? I wish I had soulful eyes. Diana is going to teach me to sing a
      song called ‘Nelly in the Hazel Dell.’ She’s going to give me
      a picture to put up in my room; it’s a perfectly beautiful picture, she
      says—a lovely lady in a pale blue silk dress. A sewing-machine agent gave
      it to her. I wish I had something to give Diana. I’m an inch taller than
      Diana, but she is ever so much fatter; she says she’d like to be thin
      because it’s so much more graceful, but I’m afraid she only said it
      to soothe my feelings. We’re going to the shore some day to gather
      shells. We have agreed to call the spring down by the log bridge the
      Dryad’s Bubble. Isn’t that a perfectly elegant name? I read a story
      once about a spring called that. A dryad is sort of a grown-up fairy, I
      think.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Well, all I hope is you won’t talk Diana to death,” said
      Marilla. “But remember this in all your planning, Anne. You’re not
      going to play all the time nor most of it. You’ll have your work to do
      and it’ll have to be done first.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Anne’s cup of happiness was full, and Matthew caused it to overflow. He
      had just got home from a trip to the store at Carmody, and he sheepishly
      produced a small parcel from his pocket and handed it to Anne, with a
      deprecatory look at Marilla.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I heard you say you liked chocolate sweeties, so I got you some,”
      he said.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Humph,” sniffed Marilla. “It’ll ruin her teeth and
      stomach. There, there, child, don’t look so dismal. You can eat those,
      since Matthew has gone and got them. He’d better have brought you
      peppermints. They’re wholesomer. Don’t sicken yourself eating all
      them at once now.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Oh, no, indeed, I won’t,” said Anne eagerly.
      “I’ll just eat one tonight, Marilla. And I can give Diana half of
      them, can’t I? The other half will taste twice as sweet to me if I give
      some to her. It’s delightful to think I have something to give
      her.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I will say it for the child,” said Marilla when Anne had gone to
      her gable, “she isn’t stingy. I’m glad, for of all faults I
      detest stinginess in a child. Dear me, it’s only three weeks since she
      came, and it seems as if she’d been here always. I can’t imagine
      the place without her. Now, don’t be looking I told-you-so, Matthew.
      That’s bad enough in a woman, but it isn’t to be endured in a man.
      I’m perfectly willing to own up that I’m glad I consented to keep
      the child and that I’m getting fond of her, but don’t you rub it
      in, Matthew Cuthbert.”

      CHAPTER XIII.<br>
      The Delights of Anticipation</h2>
    
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>T’S time Anne was
      in to do her sewing,” said Marilla, glancing at the clock and then out
      into the yellow August afternoon where everything drowsed in the heat.
      “She stayed playing with Diana more than half an hour more ‘n I
      gave her leave to; and now she’s perched out there on the woodpile
      talking to Matthew, nineteen to the dozen, when she knows perfectly well she
      ought to be at her work. And of course he’s listening to her like a
      perfect ninny. I never saw such an infatuated man. The more she talks and the
      odder the things she says, the more he’s delighted evidently. Anne
      Shirley, you come right in here this minute, do you hear me!”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      A series of staccato taps on the west window brought Anne flying in from the
      yard, eyes shining, cheeks faintly flushed with pink, unbraided hair streaming
      behind her in a torrent of brightness.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Oh, Marilla,” she exclaimed breathlessly, “there’s
      going to be a Sunday-school picnic next week—in Mr. Harmon
      Andrews’s field, right near the lake of Shining Waters. And Mrs.
      Superintendent Bell and Mrs. Rachel Lynde are going to make ice
      cream—think of it, Marilla—<i>ice cream!</i> And, oh, Marilla, can
      I go to it?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Just look at the clock, if you please, Anne. What time did I tell you to
      come in?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Two o’clock—but isn’t it splendid about the picnic,
      Marilla? Please can I go? Oh, I’ve never been to a
      picnic—I’ve dreamed of picnics, but I’ve never—”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Yes, I told you to come at two o’clock. And it’s a quarter
      to three. I’d like to know why you didn’t obey me, Anne.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Why, I meant to, Marilla, as much as could be. But you have no idea how
      fascinating Idlewild is. And then, of course, I had to tell Matthew about the
      picnic. Matthew is such a sympathetic listener. Please can I go?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “You’ll have to learn to resist the fascination of
      Idle-whatever-you-call-it. When I tell you to come in at a certain time I mean
      that time and not half an hour later. And you needn’t stop to discourse
      with sympathetic listeners on your way, either. As for the picnic, of course
      you can go. You’re a Sunday-school scholar, and it’s not likely
      I’d refuse to let you go when all the other little girls are
      going.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “But—but,” faltered Anne, “Diana says that everybody
      must take a basket of things to eat. I can’t cook, as you know, Marilla,
      and—and—I don’t mind going to a picnic without puffed sleeves
      so much, but I’d feel terribly humiliated if I had to go without a
      basket. It’s been preying on my mind ever since Diana told me.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Well, it needn’t prey any longer. I’ll bake you a
      basket.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Oh, you dear good Marilla. Oh, you are so kind to me. Oh, I’m so
      much obliged to you.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Getting through with her “ohs” Anne cast herself into
      Marilla’s arms and rapturously kissed her sallow cheek. It was the first
      time in her whole life that childish lips had voluntarily touched
      Marilla’s face. Again that sudden sensation of startling sweetness
      thrilled her. She was secretly vastly pleased at Anne’s impulsive caress,
      which was probably the reason why she said brusquely:
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “There, there, never mind your kissing nonsense. I’d sooner see you
      doing strictly as you’re told. As for cooking, I mean to begin giving you
      lessons in that some of these days. But you’re so featherbrained, Anne,
      I’ve been waiting to see if you’d sober down a little and learn to
      be steady before I begin. You’ve got to keep your wits about you in
      cooking and not stop in the middle of things to let your thoughts rove all over
      creation. Now, get out your patchwork and have your square done before
      teatime.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I do <i>not</i> like patchwork,” said Anne dolefully, hunting out
      her workbasket and sitting down before a little heap of red and white diamonds
      with a sigh. “I think some kinds of sewing would be nice; but
      there’s no scope for imagination in patchwork. It’s just one little
      seam after another and you never seem to be getting anywhere. But of course
      I’d rather be Anne of Green Gables sewing patchwork than Anne of any
      other place with nothing to do but play. I wish time went as quick sewing
      patches as it does when I’m playing with Diana, though. Oh, we do have
      such elegant times, Marilla. I have to furnish most of the imagination, but
      I’m well able to do that. Diana is simply perfect in every other way. You
      know that little piece of land across the brook that runs up between our farm
      and Mr. Barry’s. It belongs to Mr. William Bell, and right in the corner
      there is a little ring of white birch trees—the most romantic spot,
      Marilla. Diana and I have our playhouse there. We call it Idlewild. Isn’t
      that a poetical name? I assure you it took me some time to think it out. I
      stayed awake nearly a whole night before I invented it. Then, just as I was
      dropping off to sleep, it came like an inspiration. Diana was <i>enraptured</i>
      when she heard it. We have got our house fixed up elegantly. You must come and
      see it, Marilla—won’t you? We have great big stones, all covered
      with moss, for seats, and boards from tree to tree for shelves. And we have all
      our dishes on them. Of course, they’re all broken but it’s the
      easiest thing in the world to imagine that they are whole. There’s a
      piece of a plate with a spray of red and yellow ivy on it that is especially
      beautiful. We keep it in the parlor and we have the fairy glass there, too. The
      fairy glass is as lovely as a dream. Diana found it out in the woods behind
      their chicken house. It’s all full of rainbows—just little young
      rainbows that haven’t grown big yet—and Diana’s mother told
      her it was broken off a hanging lamp they once had. But it’s nice to
      imagine the fairies lost it one night when they had a ball, so we call it the
      fairy glass. Matthew is going to make us a table. Oh, we have named that little
      round pool over in Mr. Barry’s field Willowmere. I got that name out of
      the book Diana lent me. That was a thrilling book, Marilla. The heroine had
      five lovers. I’d be satisfied with one, wouldn’t you? She was very
      handsome and she went through great tribulations. She could faint as easy as
      anything. I’d love to be able to faint, wouldn’t you, Marilla?
      It’s so romantic. But I’m really very healthy for all I’m so
      thin. I believe I’m getting fatter, though. Don’t you think I am? I
      look at my elbows every morning when I get up to see if any dimples are coming.
      Diana is having a new dress made with elbow sleeves. She is going to wear it to
      the picnic. Oh, I do hope it will be fine next Wednesday. I don’t feel
      that I could endure the disappointment if anything happened to prevent me from
      getting to the picnic. I suppose I’d live through it, but I’m
      certain it would be a lifelong sorrow. It wouldn’t matter if I got to a
      hundred picnics in after years; they wouldn’t make up for missing this
      one. They’re going to have boats on the Lake of Shining Waters—and
      ice cream, as I told you. I have never tasted ice cream. Diana tried to explain
      what it was like, but I guess ice cream is one of those things that are beyond
      imagination.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Anne, you have talked even on for ten minutes by the clock,” said
      Marilla. “Now, just for curiosity’s sake, see if you can hold your
      tongue for the same length of time.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Anne held her tongue as desired. But for the rest of the week she talked picnic
      and thought picnic and dreamed picnic. On Saturday it rained and she worked
      herself up into such a frantic state lest it should keep on raining until and
      over Wednesday that Marilla made her sew an extra patchwork square by way of
      steadying her nerves.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      On Sunday Anne confided to Marilla on the way home from church that she grew
      actually cold all over with excitement when the minister announced the picnic
      from the pulpit.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Such a thrill as went up and down my back, Marilla! I don’t think
      I’d ever really believed until then that there was honestly going to be a
      picnic. I couldn’t help fearing I’d only imagined it. But when a
      minister says a thing in the pulpit you just have to believe it.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “You set your heart too much on things, Anne,” said Marilla, with a
      sigh. “I’m afraid there’ll be a great many disappointments in
      store for you through life.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Oh, Marilla, looking forward to things is half the pleasure of
      them,” exclaimed Anne. “You mayn’t get the things themselves;
      but nothing can prevent you from having the fun of looking forward to them.
      Mrs. Lynde says, ‘Blessed are they who expect nothing for they shall not
      be disappointed.’ But I think it would be worse to expect nothing than to
      be disappointed.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Marilla wore her amethyst brooch to church that day as usual. Marilla always
      wore her amethyst brooch to church. She would have thought it rather
      sacrilegious to leave it off—as bad as forgetting her Bible or her
      collection dime. That amethyst brooch was Marilla’s most treasured
      possession. A seafaring uncle had given it to her mother who in turn had
      bequeathed it to Marilla. It was an old-fashioned oval, containing a braid of
      her mother’s hair, surrounded by a border of very fine amethysts. Marilla
      knew too little about precious stones to realize how fine the amethysts
      actually were; but she thought them very beautiful and was always pleasantly
      conscious of their violet shimmer at her throat, above her good brown satin
      dress, even although she could not see it.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Anne had been smitten with delighted admiration when she first saw that brooch.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Oh, Marilla, it’s a perfectly elegant brooch. I don’t know
      how you can pay attention to the sermon or the prayers when you have it on. I
      couldn’t, I know. I think amethysts are just sweet. They are what I used
      to think diamonds were like. Long ago, before I had ever seen a diamond, I read
      about them and I tried to imagine what they would be like. I thought they would
      be lovely glimmering purple stones. When I saw a real diamond in a lady’s
      ring one day I was so disappointed I cried. Of course, it was very lovely but
      it wasn’t my idea of a diamond. Will you let me hold the brooch for one
      minute, Marilla? Do you think amethysts can be the souls of good
      violets?”

    <p>
      “Anne,” she said to that small personage, who was shelling peas by
      the spotless table and singing, “Nelly of the Hazel Dell” with a
      vigor and expression that did credit to Diana’s teaching, “did you
      see anything of my amethyst brooch? I thought I stuck it in my pincushion when
      I came home from church yesterday evening, but I can’t find it
      anywhere.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I—I saw it this afternoon when you were away at the Aid
      Society,” said Anne, a little slowly. “I was passing your door when
      I saw it on the cushion, so I went in to look at it.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Did you touch it?” said Marilla sternly.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Y-e-e-s,” admitted Anne, “I took it up and I pinned it on my
      breast just to see how it would look.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “You had no business to do anything of the sort. It’s very wrong in
      a little girl to meddle. You shouldn’t have gone into my room in the
      first place and you shouldn’t have touched a brooch that didn’t
      belong to you in the second. Where did you put it?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Oh, I put it back on the bureau. I hadn’t it on a minute. Truly, I
      didn’t mean to meddle, Marilla. I didn’t think about its being
      wrong to go in and try on the brooch; but I see now that it was and I’ll
      never do it again. That’s one good thing about me. I never do the same
      naughty thing twice.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “You didn’t put it back,” said Marilla. “That brooch
      isn’t anywhere on the bureau. You’ve taken it out or something,
      Anne.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I did put it back,” said Anne quickly—pertly, Marilla
      thought. “I don’t just remember whether I stuck it on the
      pincushion or laid it in the china tray. But I’m perfectly certain I put
      it back.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I’ll go and have another look,” said Marilla, determining to
      be just. “If you put that brooch back it’s there still. If it
      isn’t I’ll know you didn’t, that’s all!”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Marilla went to her room and made a thorough search, not only over the bureau
      but in every other place she thought the brooch might possibly be. It was not
      to be found and she returned to the kitchen.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Anne, the brooch is gone. By your own admission you were the last person
      to handle it. Now, what have you done with it? Tell me the truth at once. Did
      you take it out and lose it?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “No, I didn’t,” said Anne solemnly, meeting Marilla’s
      angry gaze squarely. “I never took the brooch out of your room and that
      is the truth, if I was to be led to the block for it—although I’m
      not very certain what a block is. So there, Marilla.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Anne’s “so there” was only intended to emphasize her
      assertion, but Marilla took it as a display of defiance.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I believe you are telling me a falsehood, Anne,” she said sharply.
      “I know you are. There now, don’t say anything more unless you are
      prepared to tell the whole truth. Go to your room and stay there until you are
      ready to confess.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Will I take the peas with me?” said Anne meekly.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “No, I’ll finish shelling them myself. Do as I bid you.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      When Anne had gone Marilla went about her evening tasks in a very disturbed
      state of mind. She was worried about her valuable brooch. What if Anne had lost
      it? And how wicked of the child to deny having taken it, when anybody could see
      she must have! With such an innocent face, too!
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I don’t know what I wouldn’t sooner have had happen,”
      thought Marilla, as she nervously shelled the peas. “Of course, I
      don’t suppose she meant to steal it or anything like that. She’s
      just taken it to play with or help along that imagination of hers. She must
      have taken it, that’s clear, for there hasn’t been a soul in that
      room since she was in it, by her own story, until I went up tonight. And the
      brooch is gone, there’s nothing surer. I suppose she has lost it and is
      afraid to own up for fear she’ll be punished. It’s a dreadful thing
      to think she tells falsehoods. It’s a far worse thing than her fit of
      temper. It’s a fearful responsibility to have a child in your house you
      can’t trust. Slyness and untruthfulness—that’s what she has
      displayed. I declare I feel worse about that than about the brooch. If
      she’d only have told the truth about it I wouldn’t mind so
      much.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Marilla went to her room at intervals all through the evening and searched for
      the brooch, without finding it. A bedtime visit to the east gable produced no
      result. Anne persisted in denying that she knew anything about the brooch but
      Marilla was only the more firmly convinced that she did.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      She told Matthew the story the next morning. Matthew was confounded and
      puzzled; he could not so quickly lose faith in Anne but he had to admit that
      circumstances were against her.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “You’re sure it hasn’t fell down behind the bureau?”
      was the only suggestion he could offer.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I’ve moved the bureau and I’ve taken out the drawers and
      I’ve looked in every crack and cranny” was Marilla’s positive
      answer. “The brooch is gone and that child has taken it and lied about
      it. That’s the plain, ugly truth, Matthew Cuthbert, and we might as well
      look it in the face.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Well now, what are you going to do about it?” Matthew asked
      forlornly, feeling secretly thankful that Marilla and not he had to deal with
      the situation. He felt no desire to put his oar in this time.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “She’ll stay in her room until she confesses,” said Marilla
      grimly, remembering the success of this method in the former case. “Then
      we’ll see. Perhaps we’ll be able to find the brooch if she’ll
      only tell where she took it; but in any case she’ll have to be severely
      punished, Matthew.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Well now, you’ll have to punish her,” said Matthew, reaching
      for his hat. “I’ve nothing to do with it, remember. You warned me
      off yourself.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Marilla felt deserted by everyone. She could not even go to Mrs. Lynde for
      advice. She went up to the east gable with a very serious face and left it with
      a face more serious still. Anne steadfastly refused to confess. She persisted
      in asserting that she had not taken the brooch. The child had evidently been
      crying and Marilla felt a pang of pity which she sternly repressed. By night
      she was, as she expressed it, “beat out.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “You’ll stay in this room until you confess, Anne. You can make up
      your mind to that,” she said firmly.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “But the picnic is tomorrow, Marilla,” cried Anne. “You
      won’t keep me from going to that, will you? You’ll just let me out
      for the afternoon, won’t you? Then I’ll stay here as long as you
      like <i>afterwards</i> cheerfully. But I <i>must</i> go to the picnic.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “You’ll not go to picnics nor anywhere else until you’ve
      confessed, Anne.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Oh, Marilla,” gasped Anne.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      But Marilla had gone out and shut the door.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Wednesday morning dawned as bright and fair as if expressly made to order for
      the picnic. Birds sang around Green Gables; the Madonna lilies in the garden
      sent out whiffs of perfume that entered in on viewless winds at every door and
      window, and wandered through halls and rooms like spirits of benediction. The
      birches in the hollow waved joyful hands as if watching for Anne’s usual
      morning greeting from the east gable. But Anne was not at her window. When
      Marilla took her breakfast up to her she found the child sitting primly on her
      bed, pale and resolute, with tight-shut lips and gleaming eyes.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Marilla, I’m ready to confess.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Ah!” Marilla laid down her tray. Once again her method had
      succeeded; but her success was very bitter to her. “Let me hear what you
      have to say then, Anne.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I took the amethyst brooch,” said Anne, as if repeating a lesson
      she had learned. “I took it just as you said. I didn’t mean to take
      it when I went in. But it did look so beautiful, Marilla, when I pinned it on
      my breast that I was overcome by an irresistible temptation. I imagined how
      perfectly thrilling it would be to take it to Idlewild and play I was the Lady
      Cordelia Fitzgerald. It would be so much easier to imagine I was the Lady
      Cordelia if I had a real amethyst brooch on. Diana and I make necklaces of
      roseberries but what are roseberries compared to amethysts? So I took the
      brooch. I thought I could put it back before you came home. I went all the way
      around by the road to lengthen out the time. When I was going over the bridge
      across the Lake of Shining Waters I took the brooch off to have another look at
      it. Oh, how it did shine in the sunlight! And then, when I was leaning over the
      bridge, it just slipped through my fingers—so—and went
      down—down—down, all purply-sparkling, and sank forevermore beneath
      the Lake of Shining Waters. And that’s the best I can do at confessing,
      Marilla.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Marilla felt hot anger surge up into her heart again. This child had taken and
      lost her treasured amethyst brooch and now sat there calmly reciting the
      details thereof without the least apparent compunction or repentance.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Anne, this is terrible,” she said, trying to speak calmly.
      “You are the very wickedest girl I ever heard of.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Yes, I suppose I am,” agreed Anne tranquilly. “And I know
      I’ll have to be punished. It’ll be your duty to punish me, Marilla.
      Won’t you please get it over right off because I’d like to go to
      the picnic with nothing on my mind.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Picnic, indeed! You’ll go to no picnic today, Anne Shirley. That
      shall be your punishment. And it isn’t half severe enough either for what
      you’ve done!”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Not go to the picnic!” Anne sprang to her feet and clutched
      Marilla’s hand. “But you <i>promised</i> me I might! Oh, Marilla, I
      must go to the picnic. That was why I confessed. Punish me any way you like but
      that. Oh, Marilla, please, please, let me go to the picnic. Think of the ice
      cream! For anything you know I may never have a chance to taste ice cream
      again.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Marilla disengaged Anne’s clinging hands stonily.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “You needn’t plead, Anne. You are not going to the picnic and
      that’s final. No, not a word.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Anne realized that Marilla was not to be moved. She clasped her hands together,
      gave a piercing shriek, and then flung herself face downward on the bed, crying
      and writhing in an utter abandonment of disappointment and despair.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “For the land’s sake!” gasped Marilla, hastening from the
      room. “I believe the child is crazy. No child in her senses would behave
      as she does. If she isn’t she’s utterly bad. Oh dear, I’m
      afraid Rachel was right from the first. But I’ve put my hand to the plow
      and I won’t look back.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      That was a dismal morning. Marilla worked fiercely and scrubbed the porch floor
      and the dairy shelves when she could find nothing else to do. Neither the
      shelves nor the porch needed it—but Marilla did. Then she went out and
      raked the yard.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      When dinner was ready she went to the stairs and called Anne. A tear-stained
      face appeared, looking tragically over the banisters.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Come down to your dinner, Anne.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I don’t want any dinner, Marilla,” said Anne, sobbingly.
      “I couldn’t eat anything. My heart is broken. You’ll feel
      remorse of conscience someday, I expect, for breaking it, Marilla, but I
      forgive you. Remember when the time comes that I forgive you. But please
      don’t ask me to eat anything, especially boiled pork and greens. Boiled
      pork and greens are so unromantic when one is in affliction.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Exasperated, Marilla returned to the kitchen and poured out her tale of woe to
      Matthew, who, between his sense of justice and his unlawful sympathy with Anne,
      was a miserable man.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Well now, she shouldn’t have taken the brooch, Marilla, or told
      stories about it,” he admitted, mournfully surveying his plateful of
      unromantic pork and greens as if he, like Anne, thought it a food unsuited to
      crises of feeling, “but she’s such a little thing—such an
      interesting little thing. Don’t you think it’s pretty rough not to
      let her go to the picnic when she’s so set on it?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Matthew Cuthbert, I’m amazed at you. I think I’ve let her
      off entirely too easy. And she doesn’t appear to realize how wicked
      she’s been at all—that’s what worries me most. If she’d
      really felt sorry it wouldn’t be so bad. And you don’t seem to
      realize it, neither; you’re making excuses for her all the time to
      yourself—I can see that.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Well now, she’s such a little thing,” feebly reiterated
      Matthew. “And there should be allowances made, Marilla. You know
      she’s never had any bringing up.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Well, she’s having it now” retorted Marilla.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The retort silenced Matthew if it did not convince him. That dinner was a very
      dismal meal. The only cheerful thing about it was Jerry Buote, the hired boy,
      and Marilla resented his cheerfulness as a personal insult.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      When her dishes were washed and her bread sponge set and her hens fed Marilla
      remembered that she had noticed a small rent in her best black lace shawl when
      she had taken it off on Monday afternoon on returning from the Ladies’
      Aid.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      She would go and mend it. The shawl was in a box in her trunk. As Marilla
      lifted it out, the sunlight, falling through the vines that clustered thickly
      about the window, struck upon something caught in the shawl—something
      that glittered and sparkled in facets of violet light. Marilla snatched at it
      with a gasp. It was the amethyst brooch, hanging to a thread of the lace by its
      catch!
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Dear life and heart,” said Marilla blankly, “what does this
      mean? Here’s my brooch safe and sound that I thought was at the bottom of
      Barry’s pond. Whatever did that girl mean by saying she took it and lost
      it? I declare I believe Green Gables is bewitched. I remember now that when I
      took off my shawl Monday afternoon I laid it on the bureau for a minute. I
      suppose the brooch got caught in it somehow. Well!”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Marilla betook herself to the east gable, brooch in hand. Anne had cried
      herself out and was sitting dejectedly by the window.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Anne Shirley,” said Marilla solemnly, “I’ve just found
      my brooch hanging to my black lace shawl. Now I want to know what that
      rigmarole you told me this morning meant.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Why, you said you’d keep me here until I confessed,”
      returned Anne wearily, “and so I decided to confess because I was bound
      to get to the picnic. I thought out a confession last night after I went to bed
      and made it as interesting as I could. And I said it over and over so that I
      wouldn’t forget it. But you wouldn’t let me go to the picnic after
      all, so all my trouble was wasted.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Marilla had to laugh in spite of herself. But her conscience pricked her.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Anne, you do beat all! But I was wrong—I see that now. I
      shouldn’t have doubted your word when I’d never known you to tell a
      story. Of course, it wasn’t right for you to confess to a thing you
      hadn’t done—it was very wrong to do so. But I drove you to it. So
      if you’ll forgive me, Anne, I’ll forgive you and we’ll start
      square again. And now get yourself ready for the picnic.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Anne flew up like a rocket.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Oh, Marilla, isn’t it too late?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “No, it’s only two o’clock. They won’t be more than
      well gathered yet and it’ll be an hour before they have tea. Wash your
      face and comb your hair and put on your gingham. I’ll fill a basket for
      you. There’s plenty of stuff baked in the house. And I’ll get Jerry
      to hitch up the sorrel and drive you down to the picnic ground.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Oh, Marilla,” exclaimed Anne, flying to the washstand. “Five
      minutes ago I was so miserable I was wishing I’d never been born and now
      I wouldn’t change places with an angel!”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      That night a thoroughly happy, completely tired-out Anne returned to Green
      Gables in a state of beatification impossible to describe.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Oh, Marilla, I’ve had a perfectly scrumptious time. Scrumptious is
      a new word I learned today. I heard Mary Alice Bell use it. Isn’t it very
      expressive? Everything was lovely. We had a splendid tea and then Mr. Harmon
      Andrews took us all for a row on the Lake of Shining Waters—six of us at
      a time. And Jane Andrews nearly fell overboard. She was leaning out to pick
      water lilies and if Mr. Andrews hadn’t caught her by her sash just in the
      nick of time she’d fallen in and prob’ly been drowned. I wish it
      had been me. It would have been such a romantic experience to have been nearly
      drowned. It would be such a thrilling tale to tell. And we had the ice cream.
      Words fail me to describe that ice cream. Marilla, I assure you it was
      sublime.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      That evening Marilla told the whole story to Matthew over her stocking basket.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I’m willing to own up that I made a mistake,” she concluded
      candidly, “but I’ve learned a lesson. I have to laugh when I think
      of Anne’s ‘confession,’ although I suppose I shouldn’t
      for it really was a falsehood. But it doesn’t seem as bad as the other
      would have been, somehow, and anyhow I’m responsible for it. That child
      is hard to understand in some respects. But I believe she’ll turn out all
      right yet. And there’s one thing certain, no house will ever be dull that
      she’s in.”

      CHAPTER XV.<br>
      A Tempest in the School Teapot</h2>
    
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>HAT a splendid
      day!” said Anne, drawing a long breath. “Isn’t it good just
      to be alive on a day like this? I pity the people who aren’t born yet for
      missing it. They may have good days, of course, but they can never have this
      one. And it’s splendider still to have such a lovely way to go to school
      by, isn’t it?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “It’s a lot nicer than going round by the road; that is so dusty
      and hot,” said Diana practically, peeping into her dinner basket and
      mentally calculating if the three juicy, toothsome, raspberry tarts reposing
      there were divided among ten girls how many bites each girl would have.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The little girls of Avonlea school always pooled their lunches, and to eat
      three raspberry tarts all alone or even to share them only with one’s
      best chum would have forever and ever branded as “awful mean” the
      girl who did it. And yet, when the tarts were divided among ten girls you just
      got enough to tantalize you.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The way Anne and Diana went to school <i>was</i> a pretty one. Anne thought
      those walks to and from school with Diana couldn’t be improved upon even
      by imagination. Going around by the main road would have been so unromantic;
      but to go by Lover’s Lane and Willowmere and Violet Vale and the Birch
      Path was romantic, if ever anything was.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Lover’s Lane opened out below the orchard at Green Gables and stretched
      far up into the woods to the end of the Cuthbert farm. It was the way by which
      the cows were taken to the back pasture and the wood hauled home in winter.
      Anne had named it Lover’s Lane before she had been a month at Green
      Gables.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Not that lovers ever really walk there,” she explained to Marilla,
      “but Diana and I are reading a perfectly magnificent book and
      there’s a Lover’s Lane in it. So we want to have one, too. And
      it’s a very pretty name, don’t you think? So romantic! We
      can’t imagine the lovers into it, you know. I like that lane because you
      can think out loud there without people calling you crazy.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Anne, starting out alone in the morning, went down Lover’s Lane as far as
      the brook. Here Diana met her, and the two little girls went on up the lane
      under the leafy arch of maples—“maples are such sociable
      trees,” said Anne; “they’re always rustling and whispering to
      you”—until they came to a rustic bridge. Then they left the lane
      and walked through Mr. Barry’s back field and past Willowmere. Beyond
      Willowmere came Violet Vale—a little green dimple in the shadow of Mr.
      Andrew Bell’s big woods. “Of course there are no violets there
      now,” Anne told Marilla, “but Diana says there are millions of them
      in spring. Oh, Marilla, can’t you just imagine you see them? It actually
      takes away my breath. I named it Violet Vale. Diana says she never saw the beat
      of me for hitting on fancy names for places. It’s nice to be clever at
      something, isn’t it? But Diana named the Birch Path. She wanted to, so I
      let her; but I’m sure I could have found something more poetical than
      plain Birch Path. Anybody can think of a name like that. But the Birch Path is
      one of the prettiest places in the world, Marilla.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      It was. Other people besides Anne thought so when they stumbled on it. It was a
      little narrow, twisting path, winding down over a long hill straight through
      Mr. Bell’s woods, where the light came down sifted through so many
      emerald screens that it was as flawless as the heart of a diamond. It was
      fringed in all its length with slim young birches, white stemmed and lissom
      boughed; ferns and starflowers and wild lilies-of-the-valley and scarlet tufts
      of pigeonberries grew thickly along it; and always there was a delightful
      spiciness in the air and music of bird calls and the murmur and laugh of wood
      winds in the trees overhead. Now and then you might see a rabbit skipping
      across the road if you were quiet—which, with Anne and Diana, happened
      about once in a blue moon. Down in the valley the path came out to the main
      road and then it was just up the spruce hill to the school.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The Avonlea school was a whitewashed building, low in the eaves and wide in the
      windows, furnished inside with comfortable substantial old-fashioned desks that
      opened and shut, and were carved all over their lids with the initials and
      hieroglyphics of three generations of school children. The schoolhouse was set
      back from the road and behind it was a dusky fir wood and a brook where all the
      children put their bottles of milk in the morning to keep cool and sweet until
      dinner hour.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Marilla had seen Anne start off to school on the first day of September with
      many secret misgivings. Anne was such an odd girl. How would she get on with
      the other children? And how on earth would she ever manage to hold her tongue
      during school hours?
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Things went better than Marilla feared, however. Anne came home that evening in
      high spirits.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I think I’m going to like school here,” she announced.
      “I don’t think much of the master, though. He’s all the time
      curling his mustache and making eyes at Prissy Andrews. Prissy is grown up, you
      know. She’s sixteen and she’s studying for the entrance examination
      into Queen’s Academy at Charlottetown next year. Tillie Boulter says the
      master is <i>dead gone</i> on her. She’s got a beautiful complexion and
      curly brown hair and she does it up so elegantly. She sits in the long seat at
      the back and he sits there, too, most of the time—to explain her lessons,
      he says. But Ruby Gillis says she saw him writing something on her slate and
      when Prissy read it she blushed as red as a beet and giggled; and Ruby Gillis
      says she doesn’t believe it had anything to do with the lesson.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Anne Shirley, don’t let me hear you talking about your teacher in
      that way again,” said Marilla sharply. “You don’t go to
      school to criticize the master. I guess he can teach <i>you</i> something, and
      it’s your business to learn. And I want you to understand right off that
      you are not to come home telling tales about him. That is something I
      won’t encourage. I hope you were a good girl.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Indeed I was,” said Anne comfortably. “It wasn’t so
      hard as you might imagine, either. I sit with Diana. Our seat is right by the
      window and we can look down to the Lake of Shining Waters. There are a lot of
      nice girls in school and we had scrumptious fun playing at dinnertime.
      It’s so nice to have a lot of little girls to play with. But of course I
      like Diana best and always will. I <i>adore</i> Diana. I’m dreadfully far
      behind the others. They’re all in the fifth book and I’m only in
      the fourth. I feel that it’s kind of a disgrace. But there’s not
      one of them has such an imagination as I have and I soon found that out. We had
      reading and geography and Canadian history and dictation today. Mr. Phillips
      said my spelling was disgraceful and he held up my slate so that everybody
      could see it, all marked over. I felt so mortified, Marilla; he might have been
      politer to a stranger, I think. Ruby Gillis gave me an apple and Sophia Sloane
      lent me a lovely pink card with ‘May I see you home?’ on it.
      I’m to give it back to her tomorrow. And Tillie Boulter let me wear her
      bead ring all the afternoon. Can I have some of those pearl beads off the old
      pincushion in the garret to make myself a ring? And oh, Marilla, Jane Andrews
      told me that Minnie MacPherson told her that she heard Prissy Andrews tell Sara
      Gillis that I had a very pretty nose. Marilla, that is the first compliment I
      have ever had in my life and you can’t imagine what a strange feeling it
      gave me. Marilla, have I really a pretty nose? I know you’ll tell me the
      truth.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Your nose is well enough,” said Marilla shortly. Secretly she
      thought Anne’s nose was a remarkable pretty one; but she had no intention
      of telling her so.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      That was three weeks ago and all had gone smoothly so far. And now, this crisp
      September morning, Anne and Diana were tripping blithely down the Birch Path,
      two of the happiest little girls in Avonlea.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I guess Gilbert Blythe will be in school today,” said Diana.
      “He’s been visiting his cousins over in New Brunswick all summer
      and he only came home Saturday night. He’s <i>aw’fly</i> handsome,
      Anne. And he teases the girls something terrible. He just torments our lives
      out.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Diana’s voice indicated that she rather liked having her life tormented
      out than not.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Gilbert Blythe?” said Anne. “Isn’t his name
      that’s written up on the porch wall with Julia Bell’s and a big
      ‘Take Notice’ over them?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Yes,” said Diana, tossing her head, “but I’m sure he
      doesn’t like Julia Bell so very much. I’ve heard him say he studied
      the multiplication table by her freckles.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Oh, don’t speak about freckles to me,” implored Anne.
      “It isn’t delicate when I’ve got so many. But I do think that
      writing take-notices up on the wall about the boys and girls is the silliest
      ever. I should just like to see anybody dare to write my name up with a
      boy’s. Not, of course,” she hastened to add, “that anybody
      would.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Anne sighed. She didn’t want her name written up. But it was a little
      humiliating to know that there was no danger of it.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Nonsense,” said Diana, whose black eyes and glossy tresses had
      played such havoc with the hearts of Avonlea schoolboys that her name figured
      on the porch walls in half a dozen take-notices. “It’s only meant
      as a joke. And don’t you be too sure your name won’t ever be
      written up. Charlie Sloane is <i>dead gone</i> on you. He told his
      mother—his <i>mother</i>, mind you—that you were the smartest girl
      in school. That’s better than being good-looking.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “No, it isn’t,” said Anne, feminine to the core.
      “I’d rather be pretty than clever. And I hate Charlie Sloane, I
      can’t bear a boy with goggle eyes. If anyone wrote my name up with his
      I’d <i>never</i> get over it, Diana Barry. But it <i>is</i> nice to keep
      head of your class.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “You’ll have Gilbert in your class after this,” said Diana,
      “and he’s used to being head of his class, I can tell you.
      He’s only in the fourth book although he’s nearly fourteen. Four
      years ago his father was sick and had to go out to Alberta for his health and
      Gilbert went with him. They were there three years and Gil didn’t go to
      school hardly any until they came back. You won’t find it so easy to keep
      head after this, Anne.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I’m glad,” said Anne quickly. “I couldn’t really
      feel proud of keeping head of little boys and girls of just nine or ten. I got
      up yesterday spelling ‘ebullition.’ Josie Pye was head and, mind
      you, she peeped in her book. Mr. Phillips didn’t see her—he was
      looking at Prissy Andrews—but I did. I just swept her a look of freezing
      scorn and she got as red as a beet and spelled it wrong after all.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Those Pye girls are cheats all round,” said Diana indignantly, as
      they climbed the fence of the main road. “Gertie Pye actually went and
      put her milk bottle in my place in the brook yesterday. Did you ever? I
      don’t speak to her now.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      When Mr. Phillips was in the back of the room hearing Prissy Andrews’s
      Latin, Diana whispered to Anne, “That’s Gilbert Blythe sitting
      right across the aisle from you, Anne. Just look at him and see if you
      don’t think he’s handsome.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Anne looked accordingly. She had a good chance to do so, for the said Gilbert
      Blythe was absorbed in stealthily pinning the long yellow braid of Ruby Gillis,
      who sat in front of him, to the back of her seat. He was a tall boy, with curly
      brown hair, roguish hazel eyes, and a mouth twisted into a teasing smile.
      Presently Ruby Gillis started up to take a sum to the master; she fell back
      into her seat with a little shriek, believing that her hair was pulled out by
      the roots. Everybody looked at her and Mr. Phillips glared so sternly that Ruby
      began to cry. Gilbert had whisked the pin out of sight and was studying his
      history with the soberest face in the world; but when the commotion subsided he
      looked at Anne and winked with inexpressible drollery.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I think your Gilbert Blythe <i>is</i> handsome,” confided Anne to
      Diana, “but I think he’s very bold. It isn’t good manners to
      wink at a strange girl.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      But it was not until the afternoon that things really began to happen.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Mr. Phillips was back in the corner explaining a problem in algebra to Prissy
      Andrews and the rest of the scholars were doing pretty much as they pleased
      eating green apples, whispering, drawing pictures on their slates, and driving
      crickets harnessed to strings, up and down aisle. Gilbert Blythe was trying to
      make Anne Shirley look at him and failing utterly, because Anne was at that
      moment totally oblivious not only to the very existence of Gilbert Blythe, but
      of every other scholar in Avonlea school itself. With her chin propped on her
      hands and her eyes fixed on the blue glimpse of the Lake of Shining Waters that
      the west window afforded, she was far away in a gorgeous dreamland hearing and
      seeing nothing save her own wonderful visions.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Gilbert Blythe wasn’t used to putting himself out to make a girl look at
      him and meeting with failure. She <i>should</i> look at him, that red-haired
      Shirley girl with the little pointed chin and the big eyes that weren’t
      like the eyes of any other girl in Avonlea school.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Gilbert reached across the aisle, picked up the end of Anne’s long red
      braid, held it out at arm’s length and said in a piercing whisper:
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Carrots! Carrots!”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Then Anne looked at him with a vengeance!
    </p>
    
    <p>
      She did more than look. She sprang to her feet, her bright fancies fallen into
      cureless ruin. She flashed one indignant glance at Gilbert from eyes whose
      angry sparkle was swiftly quenched in equally angry tears.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “You mean, hateful boy!” she exclaimed passionately. “How
      dare you!”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      And then—thwack! Anne had brought her slate down on Gilbert’s head
      and cracked it—slate not head—clear across.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Avonlea school always enjoyed a scene. This was an especially enjoyable one.
      Everybody said “Oh” in horrified delight. Diana gasped. Ruby
      Gillis, who was inclined to be hysterical, began to cry. Tommy Sloane let his
      team of crickets escape him altogether while he stared open-mouthed at the
      tableau.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Mr. Phillips stalked down the aisle and laid his hand heavily on Anne’s
      shoulder.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Anne Shirley, what does this mean?” he said angrily. Anne returned
      no answer. It was asking too much of flesh and blood to expect her to tell
      before the whole school that she had been called “carrots.” Gilbert
      it was who spoke up stoutly.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “It was my fault Mr. Phillips. I teased her.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Mr. Phillips paid no heed to Gilbert.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I am sorry to see a pupil of mine displaying such a temper and such a
      vindictive spirit,” he said in a solemn tone, as if the mere fact of
      being a pupil of his ought to root out all evil passions from the hearts of
      small imperfect mortals. “Anne, go and stand on the platform in front of
      the blackboard for the rest of the afternoon.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Anne would have infinitely preferred a whipping to this punishment under which
      her sensitive spirit quivered as from a whiplash. With a white, set face she
      obeyed. Mr. Phillips took a chalk crayon and wrote on the blackboard above her
      head.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Ann Shirley has a very bad temper. Ann Shirley must learn to control her
      temper,” and then read it out loud so that even the primer class, who
      couldn’t read writing, should understand it.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Anne stood there the rest of the afternoon with that legend above her. She did
      not cry or hang her head. Anger was still too hot in her heart for that and it
      sustained her amid all her agony of humiliation. With resentful eyes and
      passion-red cheeks she confronted alike Diana’s sympathetic gaze and
      Charlie Sloane’s indignant nods and Josie Pye’s malicious smiles.
      As for Gilbert Blythe, she would not even look at him. She would <i>never</i>
      look at him again! She would never speak to him!!
    </p>
    
    <p>
      When school was dismissed Anne marched out with her red head held high. Gilbert
      Blythe tried to intercept her at the porch door.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I’m awfully sorry I made fun of your hair, Anne,” he
      whispered contritely. “Honest I am. Don’t be mad for keeps,
      now.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Anne swept by disdainfully, without look or sign of hearing. “Oh how
      could you, Anne?” breathed Diana as they went down the road half
      reproachfully, half admiringly. Diana felt that <i>she</i> could never have
      resisted Gilbert’s plea.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I shall never forgive Gilbert Blythe,” said Anne firmly.
      “And Mr. Phillips spelled my name without an e, too. The iron has entered
      into my soul, Diana.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Diana hadn’t the least idea what Anne meant but she understood it was
      something terrible.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “You mustn’t mind Gilbert making fun of your hair,” she said
      soothingly. “Why, he makes fun of all the girls. He laughs at mine
      because it’s so black. He’s called me a crow a dozen times; and I
      never heard him apologize for anything before, either.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “There’s a great deal of difference between being called a crow and
      being called carrots,” said Anne with dignity. “Gilbert Blythe has
      hurt my feelings <i>excruciatingly</i>, Diana.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      It is possible the matter might have blown over without more excruciation if
      nothing else had happened. But when things begin to happen they are apt to keep
      on.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Avonlea scholars often spent noon hour picking gum in Mr. Bell’s spruce
      grove over the hill and across his big pasture field. From there they could
      keep an eye on Eben Wright’s house, where the master boarded. When they
      saw Mr. Phillips emerging therefrom they ran for the schoolhouse; but the
      distance being about three times longer than Mr. Wright’s lane they were
      very apt to arrive there, breathless and gasping, some three minutes too late.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      On the following day Mr. Phillips was seized with one of his spasmodic fits of
      reform and announced before going home to dinner, that he should expect to find
      all the scholars in their seats when he returned. Anyone who came in late would
      be punished.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      All the boys and some of the girls went to Mr. Bell’s spruce grove as
      usual, fully intending to stay only long enough to “pick a chew.”
      But spruce groves are seductive and yellow nuts of gum beguiling; they picked
      and loitered and strayed; and as usual the first thing that recalled them to a
      sense of the flight of time was Jimmy Glover shouting from the top of a
      patriarchal old spruce “Master’s coming.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The girls who were on the ground, started first and managed to reach the
      schoolhouse in time but without a second to spare. The boys, who had to wriggle
      hastily down from the trees, were later; and Anne, who had not been picking gum
      at all but was wandering happily in the far end of the grove, waist deep among
      the bracken, singing softly to herself, with a wreath of rice lilies on her
      hair as if she were some wild divinity of the shadowy places, was latest of
      all. Anne could run like a deer, however; run she did with the impish result
      that she overtook the boys at the door and was swept into the schoolhouse among
      them just as Mr. Phillips was in the act of hanging up his hat.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Mr. Phillips’s brief reforming energy was over; he didn’t want the
      bother of punishing a dozen pupils; but it was necessary to do something to
      save his word, so he looked about for a scapegoat and found it in Anne, who had
      dropped into her seat, gasping for breath, with a forgotten lily wreath hanging
      askew over one ear and giving her a particularly rakish and disheveled
      appearance.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Anne Shirley, since you seem to be so fond of the boys’ company we
      shall indulge your taste for it this afternoon,” he said sarcastically.
      “Take those flowers out of your hair and sit with Gilbert Blythe.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The other boys snickered. Diana, turning pale with pity, plucked the wreath
      from Anne’s hair and squeezed her hand. Anne stared at the master as if
      turned to stone.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Did you hear what I said, Anne?” queried Mr. Phillips sternly.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Yes, sir,” said Anne slowly “but I didn’t suppose you
      really meant it.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I assure you I did”—still with the sarcastic inflection
      which all the children, and Anne especially, hated. It flicked on the raw.
      “Obey me at once.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      For a moment Anne looked as if she meant to disobey. Then, realizing that there
      was no help for it, she rose haughtily, stepped across the aisle, sat down
      beside Gilbert Blythe, and buried her face in her arms on the desk. Ruby
      Gillis, who got a glimpse of it as it went down, told the others going home
      from school that she’d “acksually never seen anything like
      it—it was so white, with awful little red spots in it.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      To Anne, this was as the end of all things. It was bad enough to be singled out
      for punishment from among a dozen equally guilty ones; it was worse still to be
      sent to sit with a boy, but that that boy should be Gilbert Blythe was heaping
      insult on injury to a degree utterly unbearable. Anne felt that she could not
      bear it and it would be of no use to try. Her whole being seethed with shame
      and anger and humiliation.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      At first the other scholars looked and whispered and giggled and nudged. But as
      Anne never lifted her head and as Gilbert worked fractions as if his whole soul
      was absorbed in them and them only, they soon returned to their own tasks and
      Anne was forgotten. When Mr. Phillips called the history class out Anne should
      have gone, but Anne did not move, and Mr. Phillips, who had been writing some
      verses “To Priscilla” before he called the class, was thinking
      about an obstinate rhyme still and never missed her. Once, when nobody was
      looking, Gilbert took from his desk a little pink candy heart with a gold motto
      on it, “You are sweet,” and slipped it under the curve of
      Anne’s arm. Whereupon Anne arose, took the pink heart gingerly between
      the tips of her fingers, dropped it on the floor, ground it to powder beneath
      her heel, and resumed her position without deigning to bestow a glance on
      Gilbert.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      When school went out Anne marched to her desk, ostentatiously took out
      everything therein, books and writing tablet, pen and ink, testament and
      arithmetic, and piled them neatly on her cracked slate.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “What are you taking all those things home for, Anne?” Diana wanted
      to know, as soon as they were out on the road. She had not dared to ask the
      question before.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I am not coming back to school any more,” said Anne. Diana gasped
      and stared at Anne to see if she meant it.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Will Marilla let you stay home?” she asked.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “She’ll have to,” said Anne. “I’ll <i>never</i>
      go to school to that man again.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Oh, Anne!” Diana looked as if she were ready to cry. “I do
      think you’re mean. What shall I do? Mr. Phillips will make me sit with
      that horrid Gertie Pye—I know he will because she is sitting alone. Do
      come back, Anne.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I’d do almost anything in the world for you, Diana,” said
      Anne sadly. “I’d let myself be torn limb from limb if it would do
      you any good. But I can’t do this, so please don’t ask it. You
      harrow up my very soul.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Just think of all the fun you will miss,” mourned Diana. “We
      are going to build the loveliest new house down by the brook; and we’ll
      be playing ball next week and you’ve never played ball, Anne. It’s
      tremendously exciting. And we’re going to learn a new song—Jane
      Andrews is practicing it up now; and Alice Andrews is going to bring a new
      Pansy book next week and we’re all going to read it out loud, chapter
      about, down by the brook. And you know you are so fond of reading out loud,
      Anne.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Nothing moved Anne in the least. Her mind was made up. She would not go to
      school to Mr. Phillips again; she told Marilla so when she got home.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Nonsense,” said Marilla.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “It isn’t nonsense at all,” said Anne, gazing at Marilla with
      solemn, reproachful eyes. “Don’t you understand, Marilla?
      I’ve been insulted.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Insulted fiddlesticks! You’ll go to school tomorrow as
      usual.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Oh, no.” Anne shook her head gently. “I’m not going
      back, Marilla. I’ll learn my lessons at home and I’ll be as good as
      I can be and hold my tongue all the time if it’s possible at all. But I
      will not go back to school, I assure you.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Marilla saw something remarkably like unyielding stubbornness looking out of
      Anne’s small face. She understood that she would have trouble in
      overcoming it; but she resolved wisely to say nothing more just then.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I’ll run down and see Rachel about it this evening,” she
      thought. “There’s no use reasoning with Anne now. She’s too
      worked up and I’ve an idea she can be awful stubborn if she takes the
      notion. Far as I can make out from her story, Mr. Phillips has been carrying
      matters with a rather high hand. But it would never do to say so to her.
      I’ll just talk it over with Rachel. She’s sent ten children to
      school and she ought to know something about it. She’ll have heard the
      whole story, too, by this time.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Marilla found Mrs. Lynde knitting quilts as industriously and cheerfully as
      usual.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I suppose you know what I’ve come about,” she said, a little
      shamefacedly.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Mrs. Rachel nodded.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “About Anne’s fuss in school, I reckon,” she said.
      “Tillie Boulter was in on her way home from school and told me about
      it.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I don’t know what to do with her,” said Marilla. “She
      declares she won’t go back to school. I never saw a child so worked up.
      I’ve been expecting trouble ever since she started to school. I knew
      things were going too smooth to last. She’s so high strung. What would
      you advise, Rachel?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Well, since you’ve asked my advice, Marilla,” said Mrs.
      Lynde amiably—Mrs. Lynde dearly loved to be asked for
      advice—“I’d just humor her a little at first, that’s
      what I’d do. It’s my belief that Mr. Phillips was in the wrong. Of
      course, it doesn’t do to say so to the children, you know. And of course
      he did right to punish her yesterday for giving way to temper. But today it was
      different. The others who were late should have been punished as well as Anne,
      that’s what. And I don’t believe in making the girls sit with the
      boys for punishment. It isn’t modest. Tillie Boulter was real indignant.
      She took Anne’s part right through and said all the scholars did too.
      Anne seems real popular among them, somehow. I never thought she’d take
      with them so well.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Then you really think I’d better let her stay home,” said
      Marilla in amazement.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Yes. That is I wouldn’t say school to her again until she said it
      herself. Depend upon it, Marilla, she’ll cool off in a week or so and be
      ready enough to go back of her own accord, that’s what, while, if you
      were to make her go back right off, dear knows what freak or tantrum
      she’d take next and make more trouble than ever. The less fuss made the
      better, in my opinion. She won’t miss much by not going to school, as far
      as <i>that</i> goes. Mr. Phillips isn’t any good at all as a teacher. The
      order he keeps is scandalous, that’s what, and he neglects the young fry
      and puts all his time on those big scholars he’s getting ready for
      Queen’s. He’d never have got the school for another year if his
      uncle hadn’t been a trustee—<i>the</i> trustee, for he just leads
      the other two around by the nose, that’s what. I declare, I don’t
      know what education in this Island is coming to.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Mrs. Rachel shook her head, as much as to say if she were only at the head of
      the educational system of the Province things would be much better managed.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Marilla took Mrs. Rachel’s advice and not another word was said to Anne
      about going back to school. She learned her lessons at home, did her chores,
      and played with Diana in the chilly purple autumn twilights; but when she met
      Gilbert Blythe on the road or encountered him in Sunday-school she passed him
      by with an icy contempt that was no whit thawed by his evident desire to
      appease her. Even Diana’s efforts as a peacemaker were of no avail. Anne
      had evidently made up her mind to hate Gilbert Blythe to the end of life.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      As much as she hated Gilbert, however, did she love Diana, with all the love of
      her passionate little heart, equally intense in its likes and dislikes. One
      evening Marilla, coming in from the orchard with a basket of apples, found Anne
      sitting along by the east window in the twilight, crying bitterly.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Whatever’s the matter now, Anne?” she asked.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “It’s about Diana,” sobbed Anne luxuriously. “I love
      Diana so, Marilla. I cannot ever live without her. But I know very well when we
      grow up that Diana will get married and go away and leave me. And oh, what
      shall I do? I hate her husband—I just hate him furiously. I’ve been
      imagining it all out—the wedding and everything—Diana dressed in
      snowy garments, with a veil, and looking as beautiful and regal as a queen; and
      me the bridesmaid, with a lovely dress too, and puffed sleeves, but with a
      breaking heart hid beneath my smiling face. And then bidding Diana
      goodbye-e-e—” Here Anne broke down entirely and wept with
      increasing bitterness.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Marilla turned quickly away to hide her twitching face; but it was no use; she
      collapsed on the nearest chair and burst into such a hearty and unusual peal of
      laughter that Matthew, crossing the yard outside, halted in amazement. When had
      he heard Marilla laugh like that before?
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Well, Anne Shirley,” said Marilla as soon as she could speak,
      “if you must borrow trouble, for pity’s sake borrow it handier
      home. I should think you had an imagination, sure enough.”

      CHAPTER XVI.<br>
      Diana Is Invited to Tea with Tragic Results</h2>
    
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>CTOBER was a beautiful
      month at Green Gables, when the birches in the hollow turned as golden as
      sunshine and the maples behind the orchard were royal crimson and the wild
      cherry-trees along the lane put on the loveliest shades of dark red and bronzy
      green, while the fields sunned themselves in aftermaths.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Anne reveled in the world of color about her.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Oh, Marilla,” she exclaimed one Saturday morning, coming dancing
      in with her arms full of gorgeous boughs, “I’m so glad I live in a
      world where there are Octobers. It would be terrible if we just skipped from
      September to November, wouldn’t it? Look at these maple branches.
      Don’t they give you a thrill—several thrills? I’m going to
      decorate my room with them.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Messy things,” said Marilla, whose aesthetic sense was not
      noticeably developed. “You clutter up your room entirely too much with
      out-of-doors stuff, Anne. Bedrooms were made to sleep in.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Oh, and dream in too, Marilla. And you know one can dream so much better
      in a room where there are pretty things. I’m going to put these boughs in
      the old blue jug and set them on my table.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Mind you don’t drop leaves all over the stairs then. I’m
      going on a meeting of the Aid Society at Carmody this afternoon, Anne, and I
      won’t likely be home before dark. You’ll have to get Matthew and
      Jerry their supper, so mind you don’t forget to put the tea to draw until
      you sit down at the table as you did last time.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “It was dreadful of me to forget,” said Anne apologetically,
      “but that was the afternoon I was trying to think of a name for Violet
      Vale and it crowded other things out. Matthew was so good. He never scolded a
      bit. He put the tea down himself and said we could wait awhile as well as not.
      And I told him a lovely fairy story while we were waiting, so he didn’t
      find the time long at all. It was a beautiful fairy story, Marilla. I forgot
      the end of it, so I made up an end for it myself and Matthew said he
      couldn’t tell where the join came in.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Matthew would think it all right, Anne, if you took a notion to get up
      and have dinner in the middle of the night. But you keep your wits about you
      this time. And—I don’t really know if I’m doing
      right—it may make you more addlepated than ever—but you can ask
      Diana to come over and spend the afternoon with you and have tea here.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Oh, Marilla!” Anne clasped her hands. “How perfectly lovely!
      You <i>are</i> able to imagine things after all or else you’d never have
      understood how I’ve longed for that very thing. It will seem so nice and
      grown-uppish. No fear of my forgetting to put the tea to draw when I have
      company. Oh, Marilla, can I use the rosebud spray tea set?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “No, indeed! The rosebud tea set! Well, what next? You know I never use
      that except for the minister or the Aids. You’ll put down the old brown
      tea set. But you can open the little yellow crock of cherry preserves.
      It’s time it was being used anyhow—I believe it’s beginning
      to work. And you can cut some fruit cake and have some of the cookies and
      snaps.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I can just imagine myself sitting down at the head of the table and
      pouring out the tea,” said Anne, shutting her eyes ecstatically.
      “And asking Diana if she takes sugar! I know she doesn’t but of
      course I’ll ask her just as if I didn’t know. And then pressing her
      to take another piece of fruit cake and another helping of preserves. Oh,
      Marilla, it’s a wonderful sensation just to think of it. Can I take her
      into the spare room to lay off her hat when she comes? And then into the parlor
      to sit?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “No. The sitting room will do for you and your company. But there’s
      a bottle half full of raspberry cordial that was left over from the church
      social the other night. It’s on the second shelf of the sitting-room
      closet and you and Diana can have it if you like, and a cooky to eat with it
      along in the afternoon, for I daresay Matthew ‘ll be late coming in to
      tea since he’s hauling potatoes to the vessel.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Anne flew down to the hollow, past the Dryad’s Bubble and up the spruce
      path to Orchard Slope, to ask Diana to tea. As a result just after Marilla had
      driven off to Carmody, Diana came over, dressed in <i>her</i> second-best dress
      and looking exactly as it is proper to look when asked out to tea. At other
      times she was wont to run into the kitchen without knocking; but now she
      knocked primly at the front door. And when Anne, dressed in her second best, as
      primly opened it, both little girls shook hands as gravely as if they had never
      met before. This unnatural solemnity lasted until after Diana had been taken to
      the east gable to lay off her hat and then had sat for ten minutes in the
      sitting room, toes in position.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “How is your mother?” inquired Anne politely, just as if she had
      not seen Mrs. Barry picking apples that morning in excellent health and
      spirits.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “She is very well, thank you. I suppose Mr. Cuthbert is hauling potatoes
      to the <i>lily sands</i> this afternoon, is he?” said Diana, who had
      ridden down to Mr. Harmon Andrews’s that morning in Matthew’s cart.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Yes. Our potato crop is very good this year. I hope your father’s
      crop is good too.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “It is fairly good, thank you. Have you picked many of your apples
      yet?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Oh, ever so many,” said Anne forgetting to be dignified and
      jumping up quickly. “Let’s go out to the orchard and get some of
      the Red Sweetings, Diana. Marilla says we can have all that are left on the
      tree. Marilla is a very generous woman. She said we could have fruit cake and
      cherry preserves for tea. But it isn’t good manners to tell your company
      what you are going to give them to eat, so I won’t tell you what she said
      we could have to drink. Only it begins with an R and a C and it’s bright
      red color. I love bright red drinks, don’t you? They taste twice as good
      as any other color.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The orchard, with its great sweeping boughs that bent to the ground with fruit,
      proved so delightful that the little girls spent most of the afternoon in it,
      sitting in a grassy corner where the frost had spared the green and the mellow
      autumn sunshine lingered warmly, eating apples and talking as hard as they
      could. Diana had much to tell Anne of what went on in school. She had to sit
      with Gertie Pye and she hated it; Gertie squeaked her pencil all the time and
      it just made her—Diana’s—blood run cold; Ruby Gillis had
      charmed all her warts away, true’s you live, with a magic pebble that old
      Mary Joe from the Creek gave her. You had to rub the warts with the pebble and
      then throw it away over your left shoulder at the time of the new moon and the
      warts would all go. Charlie Sloane’s name was written up with Em
      White’s on the porch wall and Em White was <i>awful mad</i> about it; Sam
      Boulter had “sassed” Mr. Phillips in class and Mr. Phillips whipped
      him and Sam’s father came down to the school and dared Mr. Phillips to
      lay a hand on one of his children again; and Mattie Andrews had a new red hood
      and a blue crossover with tassels on it and the airs she put on about it were
      perfectly sickening; and Lizzie Wright didn’t speak to Mamie Wilson
      because Mamie Wilson’s grown-up sister had cut out Lizzie Wright’s
      grown-up sister with her beau; and everybody missed Anne so and wished
      she’s come to school again; and Gilbert Blythe—
    </p>
    
    <p>
      But Anne didn’t want to hear about Gilbert Blythe. She jumped up
      hurriedly and said suppose they go in and have some raspberry cordial.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Anne looked on the second shelf of the room pantry but there was no bottle of
      raspberry cordial there. Search revealed it away back on the top shelf. Anne
      put it on a tray and set it on the table with a tumbler.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Now, please help yourself, Diana,” she said politely. “I
      don’t believe I’ll have any just now. I don’t feel as if I
      wanted any after all those apples.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Diana poured herself out a tumblerful, looked at its bright-red hue admiringly,
      and then sipped it daintily.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “That’s awfully nice raspberry cordial, Anne,” she said.
      “I didn’t know raspberry cordial was so nice.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I’m real glad you like it. Take as much as you want. I’m
      going to run out and stir the fire up. There are so many responsibilities on a
      person’s mind when they’re keeping house, isn’t there?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      When Anne came back from the kitchen Diana was drinking her second glassful of
      cordial; and, being entreated thereto by Anne, she offered no particular
      objection to the drinking of a third. The tumblerfuls were generous ones and
      the raspberry cordial was certainly very nice.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “The nicest I ever drank,” said Diana. “It’s ever so
      much nicer than Mrs. Lynde’s, although she brags of hers so much. It
      doesn’t taste a bit like hers.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I should think Marilla’s raspberry cordial would prob’ly be
      much nicer than Mrs. Lynde’s,” said Anne loyally. “Marilla is
      a famous cook. She is trying to teach me to cook but I assure you, Diana, it is
      uphill work. There’s so little scope for imagination in cookery. You just
      have to go by rules. The last time I made a cake I forgot to put the flour in.
      I was thinking the loveliest story about you and me, Diana. I thought you were
      desperately ill with smallpox and everybody deserted you, but I went boldly to
      your bedside and nursed you back to life; and then I took the smallpox and died
      and I was buried under those poplar trees in the graveyard and you planted a
      rosebush by my grave and watered it with your tears; and you never, never
      forgot the friend of your youth who sacrificed her life for you. Oh, it was
      such a pathetic tale, Diana. The tears just rained down over my cheeks while I
      mixed the cake. But I forgot the flour and the cake was a dismal failure. Flour
      is so essential to cakes, you know. Marilla was very cross and I don’t
      wonder. I’m a great trial to her. She was terribly mortified about the
      pudding sauce last week. We had a plum pudding for dinner on Tuesday and there
      was half the pudding and a pitcherful of sauce left over. Marilla said there
      was enough for another dinner and told me to set it on the pantry shelf and
      cover it. I meant to cover it just as much as could be, Diana, but when I
      carried it in I was imagining I was a nun—of course I’m a
      Protestant but I imagined I was a Catholic—taking the veil to bury a
      broken heart in cloistered seclusion; and I forgot all about covering the
      pudding sauce. I thought of it next morning and ran to the pantry. Diana, fancy
      if you can my extreme horror at finding a mouse drowned in that pudding sauce!
      I lifted the mouse out with a spoon and threw it out in the yard and then I
      washed the spoon in three waters. Marilla was out milking and I fully intended
      to ask her when she came in if I’d give the sauce to the pigs; but when
      she did come in I was imagining that I was a frost fairy going through the
      woods turning the trees red and yellow, whichever they wanted to be, so I never
      thought about the pudding sauce again and Marilla sent me out to pick apples.
      Well, Mr. and Mrs. Chester Ross from Spencervale came here that morning. You
      know they are very stylish people, especially Mrs. Chester Ross. When Marilla
      called me in dinner was all ready and everybody was at the table. I tried to be
      as polite and dignified as I could be, for I wanted Mrs. Chester Ross to think
      I was a ladylike little girl even if I wasn’t pretty. Everything went
      right until I saw Marilla coming with the plum pudding in one hand and the
      pitcher of pudding sauce <i>warmed up</i>, in the other. Diana, that was a
      terrible moment. I remembered everything and I just stood up in my place and
      shrieked out ‘Marilla, you mustn’t use that pudding sauce. There
      was a mouse drowned in it. I forgot to tell you before.’ Oh, Diana, I
      shall never forget that awful moment if I live to be a hundred. Mrs. Chester
      Ross just <i>looked</i> at me and I thought I would sink through the floor with
      mortification. She is such a perfect housekeeper and fancy what she must have
      thought of us. Marilla turned red as fire but she never said a word—then.
      She just carried that sauce and pudding out and brought in some strawberry
      preserves. She even offered me some, but I couldn’t swallow a mouthful.
      It was like heaping coals of fire on my head. After Mrs. Chester Ross went
      away, Marilla gave me a dreadful scolding. Why, Diana, what is the
      matter?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Diana had stood up very unsteadily; then she sat down again, putting her hands
      to her head.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I’m—I’m awful sick,” she said, a little thickly.
      “I—I—must go right home.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Oh, you mustn’t dream of going home without your tea,” cried
      Anne in distress. “I’ll get it right off—I’ll go and
      put the tea down this very minute.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I must go home,” repeated Diana, stupidly but determinedly.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Let me get you a lunch anyhow,” implored Anne. “Let me give
      you a bit of fruit cake and some of the cherry preserves. Lie down on the sofa
      for a little while and you’ll be better. Where do you feel bad?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I must go home,” said Diana, and that was all she would say. In
      vain Anne pleaded.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I never heard of company going home without tea,” she mourned.
      “Oh, Diana, do you suppose that it’s possible you’re really
      taking the smallpox? If you are I’ll go and nurse you, you can depend on
      that. I’ll never forsake you. But I do wish you’d stay till after
      tea. Where do you feel bad?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I’m awful dizzy,” said Diana.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      And indeed, she walked very dizzily. Anne, with tears of disappointment in her
      eyes, got Diana’s hat and went with her as far as the Barry yard fence.
      Then she wept all the way back to Green Gables, where she sorrowfully put the
      remainder of the raspberry cordial back into the pantry and got tea ready for
      Matthew and Jerry, with all the zest gone out of the performance.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The next day was Sunday and as the rain poured down in torrents from dawn till
      dusk Anne did not stir abroad from Green Gables. Monday afternoon Marilla sent
      her down to Mrs. Lynde’s on an errand. In a very short space of time Anne
      came flying back up the lane with tears rolling down her cheeks. Into the
      kitchen she dashed and flung herself face downward on the sofa in an agony.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Whatever has gone wrong now, Anne?” queried Marilla in doubt and
      dismay. “I do hope you haven’t gone and been saucy to Mrs. Lynde
      again.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      No answer from Anne save more tears and stormier sobs!
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Anne Shirley, when I ask you a question I want to be answered. Sit right
      up this very minute and tell me what you are crying about.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Anne sat up, tragedy personified.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Mrs. Lynde was up to see Mrs. Barry today and Mrs. Barry was in an awful
      state,” she wailed. “She says that I set Diana <i>drunk</i>
      Saturday and sent her home in a disgraceful condition. And she says I must be a
      thoroughly bad, wicked little girl and she’s never, never going to let
      Diana play with me again. Oh, Marilla, I’m just overcome with woe.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Marilla stared in blank amazement.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Set Diana drunk!” she said when she found her voice. “Anne
      are you or Mrs. Barry crazy? What on earth did you give her?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Not a thing but raspberry cordial,” sobbed Anne. “I never
      thought raspberry cordial would set people drunk, Marilla—not even if
      they drank three big tumblerfuls as Diana did. Oh, it sounds
      so—so—like Mrs. Thomas’s husband! But I didn’t mean to
      set her drunk.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Drunk fiddlesticks!” said Marilla, marching to the sitting-room
      pantry. There on the shelf was a bottle which she at once recognized as one
      containing some of her three-year-old homemade currant wine for which she was
      celebrated in Avonlea, although certain of the stricter sort, Mrs. Barry among
      them, disapproved strongly of it. And at the same time Marilla recollected that
      she had put the bottle of raspberry cordial down in the cellar instead of in
      the pantry as she had told Anne.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      She went back to the kitchen with the wine bottle in her hand. Her face was
      twitching in spite of herself.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Anne, you certainly have a genius for getting into trouble. You went and
      gave Diana currant wine instead of raspberry cordial. Didn’t you know the
      difference yourself?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I never tasted it,” said Anne. “I thought it was the
      cordial. I meant to be so—so—hospitable. Diana got awfully sick and
      had to go home. Mrs. Barry told Mrs. Lynde she was simply dead drunk. She just
      laughed silly-like when her mother asked her what was the matter and went to
      sleep and slept for hours. Her mother smelled her breath and knew she was
      drunk. She had a fearful headache all day yesterday. Mrs. Barry is so
      indignant. She will never believe but what I did it on purpose.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I should think she would better punish Diana for being so greedy as to
      drink three glassfuls of anything,” said Marilla shortly. “Why,
      three of those big glasses would have made her sick even if it had only been
      cordial. Well, this story will be a nice handle for those folks who are so down
      on me for making currant wine, although I haven’t made any for three
      years ever since I found out that the minister didn’t approve. I just
      kept that bottle for sickness. There, there, child, don’t cry. I
      can’t see as you were to blame although I’m sorry it happened
      so.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I must cry,” said Anne. “My heart is broken. The stars in
      their courses fight against me, Marilla. Diana and I are parted forever. Oh,
      Marilla, I little dreamed of this when first we swore our vows of
      friendship.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Don’t be foolish, Anne. Mrs. Barry will think better of it when
      she finds you’re not to blame. I suppose she thinks you’ve done it
      for a silly joke or something of that sort. You’d best go up this evening
      and tell her how it was.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “My courage fails me at the thought of facing Diana’s injured
      mother,” sighed Anne. “I wish you’d go, Marilla. You’re
      so much more dignified than I am. Likely she’d listen to you quicker than
      to me.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Well, I will,” said Marilla, reflecting that it would probably be
      the wiser course. “Don’t cry any more, Anne. It will be all
      right.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Marilla had changed her mind about it being all right by the time she got back
      from Orchard Slope. Anne was watching for her coming and flew to the porch door
      to meet her.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Oh, Marilla, I know by your face that it’s been no use,” she
      said sorrowfully. “Mrs. Barry won’t forgive me?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Mrs. Barry indeed!” snapped Marilla. “Of all the
      unreasonable women I ever saw she’s the worst. I told her it was all a
      mistake and you weren’t to blame, but she just simply didn’t
      believe me. And she rubbed it well in about my currant wine and how I’d
      always said it couldn’t have the least effect on anybody. I just told her
      plainly that currant wine wasn’t meant to be drunk three tumblerfuls at a
      time and that if a child I had to do with was so greedy I’d sober her up
      with a right good spanking.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Marilla whisked into the kitchen, grievously disturbed, leaving a very much
      distracted little soul in the porch behind her. Presently Anne stepped out
      bareheaded into the chill autumn dusk; very determinedly and steadily she took
      her way down through the sere clover field over the log bridge and up through
      the spruce grove, lighted by a pale little moon hanging low over the western
      woods. Mrs. Barry, coming to the door in answer to a timid knock, found a
      white-lipped eager-eyed suppliant on the doorstep.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Her face hardened. Mrs. Barry was a woman of strong prejudices and dislikes,
      and her anger was of the cold, sullen sort which is always hardest to overcome.
      To do her justice, she really believed Anne had made Diana drunk out of sheer
      malice prepense, and she was honestly anxious to preserve her little daughter
      from the contamination of further intimacy with such a child.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “What do you want?” she said stiffly.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Anne clasped her hands.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Oh, Mrs. Barry, please forgive me. I did not mean
      to—to—intoxicate Diana. How could I? Just imagine if you were a
      poor little orphan girl that kind people had adopted and you had just one bosom
      friend in all the world. Do you think you would intoxicate her on purpose? I
      thought it was only raspberry cordial. I was firmly convinced it was raspberry
      cordial. Oh, please don’t say that you won’t let Diana play with me
      any more. If you do you will cover my life with a dark cloud of woe.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      This speech which would have softened good Mrs. Lynde’s heart in a
      twinkling, had no effect on Mrs. Barry except to irritate her still more. She
      was suspicious of Anne’s big words and dramatic gestures and imagined
      that the child was making fun of her. So she said, coldly and cruelly:
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I don’t think you are a fit little girl for Diana to associate
      with. You’d better go home and behave yourself.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Anne’s lips quivered.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Won’t you let me see Diana just once to say farewell?” she
      implored.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Diana has gone over to Carmody with her father,” said Mrs. Barry,
      going in and shutting the door.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Anne went back to Green Gables calm with despair.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “My last hope is gone,” she told Marilla. “I went up and saw
      Mrs. Barry myself and she treated me very insultingly. Marilla, I do <i>not</i>
      think she is a well-bred woman. There is nothing more to do except to pray and
      I haven’t much hope that that’ll do much good because, Marilla, I
      do not believe that God Himself can do very much with such an obstinate person
      as Mrs. Barry.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Anne, you shouldn’t say such things” rebuked Marilla,
      striving to overcome that unholy tendency to laughter which she was dismayed to
      find growing upon her. And indeed, when she told the whole story to Matthew
      that night, she did laugh heartily over Anne’s tribulations.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      But when she slipped into the east gable before going to bed and found that
      Anne had cried herself to sleep an unaccustomed softness crept into her face.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Poor little soul,” she murmured, lifting a loose curl of hair from
      the child’s tear-stained face. Then she bent down and kissed the flushed
      cheek on the pillow.

      CHAPTER XVII.<br>
      A New Interest in Life</h2>
    
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE next afternoon Anne,
      bending over her patchwork at the kitchen window, happened to glance out and
      beheld Diana down by the Dryad’s Bubble beckoning mysteriously. In a
      trice Anne was out of the house and flying down to the hollow, astonishment and
      hope struggling in her expressive eyes. But the hope faded when she saw
      Diana’s dejected countenance.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Your mother hasn’t relented?” she gasped.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Diana shook her head mournfully.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “No; and oh, Anne, she says I’m never to play with you again.
      I’ve cried and cried and I told her it wasn’t your fault, but it
      wasn’t any use. I had ever such a time coaxing her to let me come down
      and say good-bye to you. She said I was only to stay ten minutes and
      she’s timing me by the clock.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Ten minutes isn’t very long to say an eternal farewell in,”
      said Anne tearfully. “Oh, Diana, will you promise faithfully never to
      forget me, the friend of your youth, no matter what dearer friends may caress
      thee?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Indeed I will,” sobbed Diana, “and I’ll never have
      another bosom friend—I don’t want to have. I couldn’t love
      anybody as I love you.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Oh, Diana,” cried Anne, clasping her hands, “do you
      <i>love</i> me?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Why, of course I do. Didn’t you know that?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “No.” Anne drew a long breath. “I thought you <i>liked</i> me
      of course but I never hoped you <i>loved</i> me. Why, Diana, I didn’t
      think anybody could love me. Nobody ever has loved me since I can remember. Oh,
      this is wonderful! It’s a ray of light which will forever shine on the
      darkness of a path severed from thee, Diana. Oh, just say it once again.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I love you devotedly, Anne,” said Diana stanchly, “and I
      always will, you may be sure of that.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “And I will always love thee, Diana,” said Anne, solemnly extending
      her hand. “In the years to come thy memory will shine like a star over my
      lonely life, as that last story we read together says. Diana, wilt thou give me
      a lock of thy jet-black tresses in parting to treasure forevermore?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Have you got anything to cut it with?” queried Diana, wiping away
      the tears which Anne’s affecting accents had caused to flow afresh, and
      returning to practicalities.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Yes. I’ve got my patchwork scissors in my apron pocket
      fortunately,” said Anne. She solemnly clipped one of Diana’s curls.
      “Fare thee well, my beloved friend. Henceforth we must be as strangers
      though living side by side. But my heart will ever be faithful to thee.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Anne stood and watched Diana out of sight, mournfully waving her hand to the
      latter whenever she turned to look back. Then she returned to the house, not a
      little consoled for the time being by this romantic parting.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “It is all over,” she informed Marilla. “I shall never have
      another friend. I’m really worse off than ever before, for I
      haven’t Katie Maurice and Violetta now. And even if I had it
      wouldn’t be the same. Somehow, little dream girls are not satisfying
      after a real friend. Diana and I had such an affecting farewell down by the
      spring. It will be sacred in my memory forever. I used the most pathetic
      language I could think of and said ‘thou’ and ‘thee.’
      ‘Thou’ and ‘thee’ seem so much more romantic than
      ‘you.’ Diana gave me a lock of her hair and I’m going to sew
      it up in a little bag and wear it around my neck all my life. Please see that
      it is buried with me, for I don’t believe I’ll live very long.
      Perhaps when she sees me lying cold and dead before her Mrs. Barry may feel
      remorse for what she has done and will let Diana come to my funeral.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I don’t think there is much fear of your dying of grief as long as
      you can talk, Anne,” said Marilla unsympathetically.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The following Monday Anne surprised Marilla by coming down from her room with
      her basket of books on her arm and hip and her lips primmed up into a line of
      determination.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I’m going back to school,” she announced. “That is all
      there is left in life for me, now that my friend has been ruthlessly torn from
      me. In school I can look at her and muse over days departed.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “You’d better muse over your lessons and sums,” said Marilla,
      concealing her delight at this development of the situation. “If
      you’re going back to school I hope we’ll hear no more of breaking
      slates over people’s heads and such carryings on. Behave yourself and do
      just what your teacher tells you.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I’ll try to be a model pupil,” agreed Anne dolefully.
      “There won’t be much fun in it, I expect. Mr. Phillips said Minnie
      Andrews was a model pupil and there isn’t a spark of imagination or life
      in her. She is just dull and poky and never seems to have a good time. But I
      feel so depressed that perhaps it will come easy to me now. I’m going
      round by the road. I couldn’t bear to go by the Birch Path all alone. I
      should weep bitter tears if I did.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Anne was welcomed back to school with open arms. Her imagination had been
      sorely missed in games, her voice in the singing and her dramatic ability in
      the perusal aloud of books at dinner hour. Ruby Gillis smuggled three blue
      plums over to her during testament reading; Ella May MacPherson gave her an
      enormous yellow pansy cut from the covers of a floral catalogue—a species
      of desk decoration much prized in Avonlea school. Sophia Sloane offered to
      teach her a perfectly elegant new pattern of knit lace, so nice for trimming
      aprons. Katie Boulter gave her a perfume bottle to keep slate water in, and
      Julia Bell copied carefully on a piece of pale pink paper scalloped on the
      edges the following effusion:
    </p>
    
    <p class="center">
      “<small>TO ANNE</small>
    </p>
    
    <p class="poem">
      “When twilight drops her curtain down<br>
      And pins it with a star<br>
      Remember that you have a friend<br>
      Though she may wander far.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “It’s so nice to be appreciated,” sighed Anne rapturously to
      Marilla that night.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The girls were not the only scholars who “appreciated” her. When
      Anne went to her seat after dinner hour—she had been told by Mr. Phillips
      to sit with the model Minnie Andrews—she found on her desk a big luscious
      “strawberry apple.” Anne caught it up all ready to take a bite when
      she remembered that the only place in Avonlea where strawberry apples grew was
      in the old Blythe orchard on the other side of the Lake of Shining Waters. Anne
      dropped the apple as if it were a red-hot coal and ostentatiously wiped her
      fingers on her handkerchief. The apple lay untouched on her desk until the next
      morning, when little Timothy Andrews, who swept the school and kindled the
      fire, annexed it as one of his perquisites. Charlie Sloane’s slate
      pencil, gorgeously bedizened with striped red and yellow paper, costing two
      cents where ordinary pencils cost only one, which he sent up to her after
      dinner hour, met with a more favorable reception. Anne was graciously pleased
      to accept it and rewarded the donor with a smile which exalted that infatuated
      youth straightway into the seventh heaven of delight and caused him to make
      such fearful errors in his dictation that Mr. Phillips kept him in after school
      to rewrite it.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      But as,
    </p>
    
    <p class="poem">
      The Cæsar’s pageant shorn of Brutus’ bust<br>
      Did but of Rome’s best son remind her more,
    </p>
    
    <p class="noindent">
      so the marked absence of any tribute or recognition from Diana Barry who was
      sitting with Gertie Pye embittered Anne’s little triumph.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Diana might just have smiled at me once, I think,” she mourned to
      Marilla that night. But the next morning a note most fearfully and wonderfully
      twisted and folded, and a small parcel were passed across to Anne.
    </p>
    
    <p class="letter">
      “Dear Anne, ran the former, “Mother says I’m not to play with
      you or talk to you even in school. It isn’t my fault and don’t be
      cross at me, because I love you as much as ever. I miss you awfully to tell all
      my secrets to and I don’t like Gertie Pye one bit. I made you one of the
      new bookmarkers out of red tissue paper. They are awfully fashionable now and
      only three girls in school know how to make them. When you look at it remember

      Diana Barry.

      Anne read the note, kissed the bookmark, and dispatched a prompt reply back to
      the other side of the school.
    </p>
    
    <p class="letter">
      My own darling Diana:—<br>

    <p>
      Marilla pessimistically expected more trouble since Anne had again begun to go
      to school. But none developed. Perhaps Anne caught something of the
      “model” spirit from Minnie Andrews; at least she got on very well
      with Mr. Phillips thenceforth. She flung herself into her studies heart and
      soul, determined not to be outdone in any class by Gilbert Blythe. The rivalry
      between them was soon apparent; it was entirely good natured on Gilbert’s
      side; but it is much to be feared that the same thing cannot be said of Anne,
      who had certainly an unpraiseworthy tenacity for holding grudges. She was as
      intense in her hatreds as in her loves. She would not stoop to admit that she
      meant to rival Gilbert in schoolwork, because that would have been to
      acknowledge his existence which Anne persistently ignored; but the rivalry was
      there and honors fluctuated between them. Now Gilbert was head of the spelling
      class; now Anne, with a toss of her long red braids, spelled him down. One
      morning Gilbert had all his sums done correctly and had his name written on the
      blackboard on the roll of honor; the next morning Anne, having wrestled wildly
      with decimals the entire evening before, would be first. One awful day they
      were ties and their names were written up together. It was almost as bad as a
      take-notice and Anne’s mortification was as evident as Gilbert’s
      satisfaction. When the written examinations at the end of each month were held
      the suspense was terrible. The first month Gilbert came out three marks ahead.
      The second Anne beat him by five. But her triumph was marred by the fact that
      Gilbert congratulated her heartily before the whole school. It would have been
      ever so much sweeter to her if he had felt the sting of his defeat.

      Mr. Phillips might not be a very good teacher; but a pupil so inflexibly
      determined on learning as Anne was could hardly escape making progress under
      any kind of teacher. By the end of the term Anne and Gilbert were both promoted
      into the fifth class and allowed to begin studying the elements of “the
      branches”—by which Latin, geometry, French, and algebra were meant.
      In geometry Anne met her Waterloo.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “It’s perfectly awful stuff, Marilla,” she groaned.
      “I’m sure I’ll never be able to make head or tail of it.
      There is no scope for imagination in it at all. Mr. Phillips says I’m the
      worst dunce he ever saw at it. And Gil—I mean some of the others are so
      smart at it. It is extremely mortifying, Marilla.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Even Diana gets along better than I do. But I don’t mind being
      beaten by Diana. Even although we meet as strangers now I still love her with
      an <i>inextinguishable</i> love. It makes me very sad at times to think about
      her. But really, Marilla, one can’t stay sad very long in such an
      interesting world, can one?”

      CHAPTER XVIII.<br>
      Anne to the Rescue</h2>
    
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>LL things great are
      wound up with all things little. At first glance it might not seem that the
      decision of a certain Canadian Premier to include Prince Edward Island in a
      political tour could have much or anything to do with the fortunes of little
      Anne Shirley at Green Gables. But it had.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      It was a January the Premier came, to address his loyal supporters and such of
      his nonsupporters as chose to be present at the monster mass meeting held in
      Charlottetown. Most of the Avonlea people were on Premier’s side of
      politics; hence on the night of the meeting nearly all the men and a goodly
      proportion of the women had gone to town thirty miles away. Mrs. Rachel Lynde
      had gone too. Mrs. Rachel Lynde was a red-hot politician and couldn’t
      have believed that the political rally could be carried through without her,
      although she was on the opposite side of politics. So she went to town and took
      her husband—Thomas would be useful in looking after the horse—and
      Marilla Cuthbert with her. Marilla had a sneaking interest in politics herself,
      and as she thought it might be her only chance to see a real live Premier, she
      promptly took it, leaving Anne and Matthew to keep house until her return the
      following day.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Hence, while Marilla and Mrs. Rachel were enjoying themselves hugely at the
      mass meeting, Anne and Matthew had the cheerful kitchen at Green Gables all to
      themselves. A bright fire was glowing in the old-fashioned Waterloo stove and
      blue-white frost crystals were shining on the windowpanes. Matthew nodded over
      a <i>Farmers’ Advocate</i> on the sofa and Anne at the table studied her
      lessons with grim determination, despite sundry wistful glances at the clock
      shelf, where lay a new book that Jane Andrews had lent her that day. Jane had
      assured her that it was warranted to produce any number of thrills, or words to
      that effect, and Anne’s fingers tingled to reach out for it. But that
      would mean Gilbert Blythe’s triumph on the morrow. Anne turned her back
      on the clock shelf and tried to imagine it wasn’t there.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Matthew, did you ever study geometry when you went to school?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Well now, no, I didn’t,” said Matthew, coming out of his
      doze with a start.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I wish you had,” sighed Anne, “because then you’d be
      able to sympathize with me. You can’t sympathize properly if you’ve
      never studied it. It is casting a cloud over my whole life. I’m such a
      dunce at it, Matthew.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Well now, I dunno,” said Matthew soothingly. “I guess
      you’re all right at anything. Mr. Phillips told me last week in
      Blair’s store at Carmody that you was the smartest scholar in school and
      was making rapid progress. ‘Rapid progress’ was his very words.
      There’s them as runs down Teddy Phillips and says he ain’t much of
      a teacher, but I guess he’s all right.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Matthew would have thought anyone who praised Anne was “all right.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I’m sure I’d get on better with geometry if only he
      wouldn’t change the letters,” complained Anne. “I learn the
      proposition off by heart and then he draws it on the blackboard and puts
      different letters from what are in the book and I get all mixed up. I
      don’t think a teacher should take such a mean advantage, do you?
      We’re studying agriculture now and I’ve found out at last what
      makes the roads red. It’s a great comfort. I wonder how Marilla and Mrs.
      Lynde are enjoying themselves. Mrs. Lynde says Canada is going to the dogs the
      way things are being run at Ottawa and that it’s an awful warning to the
      electors. She says if women were allowed to vote we would soon see a blessed
      change. What way do you vote, Matthew?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Conservative,” said Matthew promptly. To vote Conservative was
      part of Matthew’s religion.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Then I’m Conservative too,” said Anne decidedly.
      “I’m glad because Gil—because some of the boys in school are
      Grits. I guess Mr. Phillips is a Grit too because Prissy Andrews’s father
      is one, and Ruby Gillis says that when a man is courting he always has to agree
      with the girl’s mother in religion and her father in politics. Is that
      true, Matthew?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Well now, I dunno,” said Matthew.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Did you ever go courting, Matthew?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Well now, no, I dunno’s I ever did,” said Matthew, who had
      certainly never thought of such a thing in his whole existence.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Anne reflected with her chin in her hands.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “It must be rather interesting, don’t you think, Matthew? Ruby
      Gillis says when she grows up she’s going to have ever so many beaus on
      the string and have them all crazy about her; but I think that would be too
      exciting. I’d rather have just one in his right mind. But Ruby Gillis
      knows a great deal about such matters because she has so many big sisters, and
      Mrs. Lynde says the Gillis girls have gone off like hot cakes. Mr. Phillips
      goes up to see Prissy Andrews nearly every evening. He says it is to help her
      with her lessons but Miranda Sloane is studying for Queen’s too, and I
      should think she needed help a lot more than Prissy because she’s ever so
      much stupider, but he never goes to help her in the evenings at all. There are
      a great many things in this world that I can’t understand very well,
      Matthew.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Well now, I dunno as I comprehend them all myself,” acknowledged
      Matthew.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Well, I suppose I must finish up my lessons. I won’t allow myself
      to open that new book Jane lent me until I’m through. But it’s a
      terrible temptation, Matthew. Even when I turn my back on it I can see it there
      just as plain. Jane said she cried herself sick over it. I love a book that
      makes me cry. But I think I’ll carry that book into the sitting room and
      lock it in the jam closet and give you the key. And you must <i>not</i> give it
      to me, Matthew, until my lessons are done, not even if I implore you on my
      bended knees. It’s all very well to say resist temptation, but it’s
      ever so much easier to resist it if you can’t get the key. And then shall
      I run down the cellar and get some russets, Matthew? Wouldn’t you like
      some russets?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Well now, I dunno but what I would,” said Matthew, who never ate
      russets but knew Anne’s weakness for them.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Just as Anne emerged triumphantly from the cellar with her plateful of russets
      came the sound of flying footsteps on the icy board walk outside and the next
      moment the kitchen door was flung open and in rushed Diana Barry, white faced
      and breathless, with a shawl wrapped hastily around her head. Anne promptly let
      go of her candle and plate in her surprise, and plate, candle, and apples
      crashed together down the cellar ladder and were found at the bottom embedded
      in melted grease, the next day, by Marilla, who gathered them up and thanked
      mercy the house hadn’t been set on fire.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Whatever is the matter, Diana?” cried Anne. “Has your mother
      relented at last?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Oh, Anne, do come quick,” implored Diana nervously. “Minnie
      May is awful sick—she’s got croup. Young Mary Joe says—and
      Father and Mother are away to town and there’s nobody to go for the
      doctor. Minnie May is awful bad and Young Mary Joe doesn’t know what to
      do—and oh, Anne, I’m so scared!”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Matthew, without a word, reached out for cap and coat, slipped past Diana and
      away into the darkness of the yard.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “He’s gone to harness the sorrel mare to go to Carmody for the
      doctor,” said Anne, who was hurrying on hood and jacket. “I know it
      as well as if he’d said so. Matthew and I are such kindred spirits I can
      read his thoughts without words at all.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I don’t believe he’ll find the doctor at Carmody,”
      sobbed Diana. “I know that Dr. Blair went to town and I guess Dr. Spencer
      would go too. Young Mary Joe never saw anybody with croup and Mrs. Lynde is
      away. Oh, Anne!”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Don’t cry, Di,” said Anne cheerily. “I know exactly
      what to do for croup. You forget that Mrs. Hammond had twins three times. When
      you look after three pairs of twins you naturally get a lot of experience. They
      all had croup regularly. Just wait till I get the ipecac bottle—you
      mayn’t have any at your house. Come on now.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The two little girls hastened out hand in hand and hurried through
      Lover’s Lane and across the crusted field beyond, for the snow was too
      deep to go by the shorter wood way. Anne, although sincerely sorry for Minnie
      May, was far from being insensible to the romance of the situation and to the
      sweetness of once more sharing that romance with a kindred spirit.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The night was clear and frosty, all ebony of shadow and silver of snowy slope;
      big stars were shining over the silent fields; here and there the dark pointed
      firs stood up with snow powdering their branches and the wind whistling through
      them. Anne thought it was truly delightful to go skimming through all this
      mystery and loveliness with your bosom friend who had been so long estranged.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Minnie May, aged three, was really very sick. She lay on the kitchen sofa
      feverish and restless, while her hoarse breathing could be heard all over the
      house. Young Mary Joe, a buxom, broad-faced French girl from the creek, whom
      Mrs. Barry had engaged to stay with the children during her absence, was
      helpless and bewildered, quite incapable of thinking what to do, or doing it if
      she thought of it.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Anne went to work with skill and promptness.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Minnie May has croup all right; she’s pretty bad, but I’ve
      seen them worse. First we must have lots of hot water. I declare, Diana, there
      isn’t more than a cupful in the kettle! There, I’ve filled it up,
      and, Mary Joe, you may put some wood in the stove. I don’t want to hurt
      your feelings but it seems to me you might have thought of this before if
      you’d any imagination. Now, I’ll undress Minnie May and put her to
      bed and you try to find some soft flannel cloths, Diana. I’m going to
      give her a dose of ipecac first of all.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Minnie May did not take kindly to the ipecac but Anne had not brought up three
      pairs of twins for nothing. Down that ipecac went, not only once, but many
      times during the long, anxious night when the two little girls worked patiently
      over the suffering Minnie May, and Young Mary Joe, honestly anxious to do all
      she could, kept up a roaring fire and heated more water than would have been
      needed for a hospital of croupy babies.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      It was three o’clock when Matthew came with a doctor, for he had been
      obliged to go all the way to Spencervale for one. But the pressing need for
      assistance was past. Minnie May was much better and was sleeping soundly.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I was awfully near giving up in despair,” explained Anne.
      “She got worse and worse until she was sicker than ever the Hammond twins
      were, even the last pair. I actually thought she was going to choke to death. I
      gave her every drop of ipecac in that bottle and when the last dose went down I
      said to myself—not to Diana or Young Mary Joe, because I didn’t
      want to worry them any more than they were worried, but I had to say it to
      myself just to relieve my feelings—‘This is the last lingering hope
      and I fear, tis a vain one.’ But in about three minutes she coughed up
      the phlegm and began to get better right away. You must just imagine my relief,
      doctor, because I can’t express it in words. You know there are some
      things that cannot be expressed in words.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Yes, I know,” nodded the doctor. He looked at Anne as if he were
      thinking some things about her that couldn’t be expressed in words. Later
      on, however, he expressed them to Mr. and Mrs. Barry.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “That little redheaded girl they have over at Cuthbert’s is as
      smart as they make ‘em. I tell you she saved that baby’s life, for
      it would have been too late by the time I got there. She seems to have a skill
      and presence of mind perfectly wonderful in a child of her age. I never saw
      anything like the eyes of her when she was explaining the case to me.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Anne had gone home in the wonderful, white-frosted winter morning, heavy eyed
      from loss of sleep, but still talking unweariedly to Matthew as they crossed
      the long white field and walked under the glittering fairy arch of the
      Lover’s Lane maples.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Oh, Matthew, isn’t it a wonderful morning? The world looks like
      something God had just imagined for His own pleasure, doesn’t it? Those
      trees look as if I could blow them away with a breath—pouf! I’m so
      glad I live in a world where there are white frosts, aren’t you? And
      I’m so glad Mrs. Hammond had three pairs of twins after all. If she
      hadn’t I mightn’t have known what to do for Minnie May. I’m
      real sorry I was ever cross with Mrs. Hammond for having twins. But, oh,
      Matthew, I’m so sleepy. I can’t go to school. I just know I
      couldn’t keep my eyes open and I’d be so stupid. But I hate to stay
      home, for Gil—some of the others will get head of the class, and
      it’s so hard to get up again—although of course the harder it is
      the more satisfaction you have when you do get up, haven’t you?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Well now, I guess you’ll manage all right,” said Matthew,
      looking at Anne’s white little face and the dark shadows under her eyes.
      “You just go right to bed and have a good sleep. I’ll do all the
      chores.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Anne accordingly went to bed and slept so long and soundly that it was well on
      in the white and rosy winter afternoon when she awoke and descended to the
      kitchen where Marilla, who had arrived home in the meantime, was sitting
      knitting.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Oh, did you see the Premier?” exclaimed Anne at once. “What
      did he look like Marilla?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Well, he never got to be Premier on account of his looks,” said
      Marilla. “Such a nose as that man had! But he can speak. I was proud of
      being a Conservative. Rachel Lynde, of course, being a Liberal, had no use for
      him. Your dinner is in the oven, Anne, and you can get yourself some blue plum
      preserve out of the pantry. I guess you’re hungry. Matthew has been
      telling me about last night. I must say it was fortunate you knew what to do. I
      wouldn’t have had any idea myself, for I never saw a case of croup. There
      now, never mind talking till you’ve had your dinner. I can tell by the
      look of you that you’re just full up with speeches, but they’ll
      keep.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Marilla had something to tell Anne, but she did not tell it just then for she
      knew if she did Anne’s consequent excitement would lift her clear out of
      the region of such material matters as appetite or dinner. Not until Anne had
      finished her saucer of blue plums did Marilla say:
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Mrs. Barry was here this afternoon, Anne. She wanted to see you, but I
      wouldn’t wake you up. She says you saved Minnie May’s life, and she
      is very sorry she acted as she did in that affair of the currant wine. She says
      she knows now you didn’t mean to set Diana drunk, and she hopes
      you’ll forgive her and be good friends with Diana again. You’re to
      go over this evening if you like for Diana can’t stir outside the door on
      account of a bad cold she caught last night. Now, Anne Shirley, for
      pity’s sake don’t fly up into the air.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The warning seemed not unnecessary, so uplifted and aerial was Anne’s
      expression and attitude as she sprang to her feet, her face irradiated with the
      flame of her spirit.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Oh, Marilla, can I go right now—without washing my dishes?
      I’ll wash them when I come back, but I cannot tie myself down to anything
      so unromantic as dishwashing at this thrilling moment.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Yes, yes, run along,” said Marilla indulgently. “Anne
      Shirley—are you crazy? Come back this instant and put something on you. I
      might as well call to the wind. She’s gone without a cap or wrap. Look at
      her tearing through the orchard with her hair streaming. It’ll be a mercy
      if she doesn’t catch her death of cold.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Anne came dancing home in the purple winter twilight across the snowy places.
      Afar in the southwest was the great shimmering, pearl-like sparkle of an
      evening star in a sky that was pale golden and ethereal rose over gleaming
      white spaces and dark glens of spruce. The tinkles of sleigh bells among the
      snowy hills came like elfin chimes through the frosty air, but their music was
      not sweeter than the song in Anne’s heart and on her lips.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “You see before you a perfectly happy person, Marilla,” she
      announced. “I’m perfectly happy—yes, in spite of my red hair.
      Just at present I have a soul above red hair. Mrs. Barry kissed me and cried
      and said she was so sorry and she could never repay me. I felt fearfully
      embarrassed, Marilla, but I just said as politely as I could, ‘I have no
      hard feelings for you, Mrs. Barry. I assure you once for all that I did not
      mean to intoxicate Diana and henceforth I shall cover the past with the mantle
      of oblivion.’ That was a pretty dignified way of speaking wasn’t
      it, Marilla?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I felt that I was heaping coals of fire on Mrs. Barry’s head. And
      Diana and I had a lovely afternoon. Diana showed me a new fancy crochet stitch
      her aunt over at Carmody taught her. Not a soul in Avonlea knows it but us, and
      we pledged a solemn vow never to reveal it to anyone else. Diana gave me a
      beautiful card with a wreath of roses on it and a verse of poetry:”
    </p>
    
    <p class="poem">
      “If you love me as I love you<br>
      Nothing but death can part us two.”
    </p>
    
    <p class="noindent">
      “And that is true, Marilla. We’re going to ask Mr. Phillips to let
      us sit together in school again, and Gertie Pye can go with Minnie Andrews. We
      had an elegant tea. Mrs. Barry had the very best china set out, Marilla, just
      as if I was real company. I can’t tell you what a thrill it gave me.
      Nobody ever used their very best china on my account before. And we had fruit
      cake and pound cake and doughnuts and two kinds of preserves, Marilla. And Mrs.
      Barry asked me if I took tea and said ‘Pa, why don’t you pass the
      biscuits to Anne?’ It must be lovely to be grown up, Marilla, when just
      being treated as if you were is so nice.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I don’t know about that,” said Marilla, with a brief sigh.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Well, anyway, when I am grown up,” said Anne decidedly,
      “I’m always going to talk to little girls as if they were too, and
      I’ll never laugh when they use big words. I know from sorrowful
      experience how that hurts one’s feelings. After tea Diana and I made
      taffy. The taffy wasn’t very good, I suppose because neither Diana nor I
      had ever made any before. Diana left me to stir it while she buttered the
      plates and I forgot and let it burn; and then when we set it out on the
      platform to cool the cat walked over one plate and that had to be thrown away.
      But the making of it was splendid fun. Then when I came home Mrs. Barry asked
      me to come over as often as I could and Diana stood at the window and threw
      kisses to me all the way down to Lover’s Lane. I assure you, Marilla,
      that I feel like praying tonight and I’m going to think out a special
      brand-new prayer in honor of the occasion.”

      CHAPTER XIX.<br>
      A Concert, a Catastrophe, and a Confession</h2>
    
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>ARILLA, can I go over
      to see Diana just for a minute?” asked Anne, running breathlessly down
      from the east gable one February evening.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I don’t see what you want to be traipsing about after dark
      for,” said Marilla shortly. “You and Diana walked home from school
      together and then stood down there in the snow for half an hour more, your
      tongues going the whole blessed time, clickety-clack. So I don’t think
      you’re very badly off to see her again.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “But she wants to see me,” pleaded Anne. “She has something
      very important to tell me.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “How do you know she has?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Because she just signaled to me from her window. We have arranged a way
      to signal with our candles and cardboard. We set the candle on the window sill
      and make flashes by passing the cardboard back and forth. So many flashes mean
      a certain thing. It was my idea, Marilla.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I’ll warrant you it was,” said Marilla emphatically.
      “And the next thing you’ll be setting fire to the curtains with
      your signaling nonsense.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Oh, we’re very careful, Marilla. And it’s so interesting.
      Two flashes mean, ‘Are you there?’ Three mean ‘yes’ and
      four ‘no.’ Five mean, ‘Come over as soon as possible, because
      I have something important to reveal.’ Diana has just signaled five
      flashes, and I’m really suffering to know what it is.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Well, you needn’t suffer any longer,” said Marilla
      sarcastically. “You can go, but you’re to be back here in just ten
      minutes, remember that.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Anne did remember it and was back in the stipulated time, although probably no
      mortal will ever know just what it cost her to confine the discussion of
      Diana’s important communication within the limits of ten minutes. But at
      least she had made good use of them.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Oh, Marilla, what do you think? You know tomorrow is Diana’s
      birthday. Well, her mother told her she could ask me to go home with her from
      school and stay all night with her. And her cousins are coming over from
      Newbridge in a big pung sleigh to go to the Debating Club concert at the hall
      tomorrow night. And they are going to take Diana and me to the concert—if
      you’ll let me go, that is. You will, won’t you, Marilla? Oh, I feel
      so excited.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “You can calm down then, because you’re not going. You’re
      better at home in your own bed, and as for that club concert, it’s all
      nonsense, and little girls should not be allowed to go out to such places at
      all.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I’m sure the Debating Club is a most respectable affair,”
      pleaded Anne.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I’m not saying it isn’t. But you’re not going to begin
      gadding about to concerts and staying out all hours of the night. Pretty doings
      for children. I’m surprised at Mrs. Barry’s letting Diana
      go.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “But it’s such a very special occasion,” mourned Anne, on the
      verge of tears. “Diana has only one birthday in a year. It isn’t as
      if birthdays were common things, Marilla. Prissy Andrews is going to recite
      ‘Curfew Must Not Ring Tonight.’ That is such a good moral piece,
      Marilla, I’m sure it would do me lots of good to hear it. And the choir
      are going to sing four lovely pathetic songs that are pretty near as good as
      hymns. And oh, Marilla, the minister is going to take part; yes, indeed, he is;
      he’s going to give an address. That will be just about the same thing as
      a sermon. Please, mayn’t I go, Marilla?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “You heard what I said, Anne, didn’t you? Take off your boots now
      and go to bed. It’s past eight.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “There’s just one more thing, Marilla,” said Anne, with the
      air of producing the last shot in her locker. “Mrs. Barry told Diana that
      we might sleep in the spare-room bed. Think of the honor of your little Anne
      being put in the spare-room bed.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “It’s an honor you’ll have to get along without. Go to bed,
      Anne, and don’t let me hear another word out of you.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      When Anne, with tears rolling over her cheeks, had gone sorrowfully upstairs,
      Matthew, who had been apparently sound asleep on the lounge during the whole
      dialogue, opened his eyes and said decidedly:
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Well now, Marilla, I think you ought to let Anne go.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I don’t then,” retorted Marilla. “Who’s bringing
      this child up, Matthew, you or me?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Well now, you,” admitted Matthew.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Don’t interfere then.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Well now, I ain’t interfering. It ain’t interfering to have
      your own opinion. And my opinion is that you ought to let Anne go.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “You’d think I ought to let Anne go to the moon if she took the
      notion, I’ve no doubt,” was Marilla’s amiable rejoinder.
      “I might have let her spend the night with Diana, if that was all. But I
      don’t approve of this concert plan. She’d go there and catch cold
      like as not, and have her head filled up with nonsense and excitement. It would
      unsettle her for a week. I understand that child’s disposition and
      what’s good for it better than you, Matthew.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I think you ought to let Anne go,” repeated Matthew firmly.
      Argument was not his strong point, but holding fast to his opinion certainly
      was. Marilla gave a gasp of helplessness and took refuge in silence. The next
      morning, when Anne was washing the breakfast dishes in the pantry, Matthew
      paused on his way out to the barn to say to Marilla again:
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I think you ought to let Anne go, Marilla.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      For a moment Marilla looked things not lawful to be uttered. Then she yielded
      to the inevitable and said tartly:
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Very well, she can go, since nothing else ‘ll please you.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Anne flew out of the pantry, dripping dishcloth in hand.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Oh, Marilla, Marilla, say those blessed words again.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I guess once is enough to say them. This is Matthew’s doings and I
      wash my hands of it. If you catch pneumonia sleeping in a strange bed or coming
      out of that hot hall in the middle of the night, don’t blame me, blame
      Matthew. Anne Shirley, you’re dripping greasy water all over the floor. I
      never saw such a careless child.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Oh, I know I’m a great trial to you, Marilla,” said Anne
      repentantly. “I make so many mistakes. But then just think of all the
      mistakes I don’t make, although I might. I’ll get some sand and
      scrub up the spots before I go to school. Oh, Marilla, my heart was just set on
      going to that concert. I never was to a concert in my life, and when the other
      girls talk about them in school I feel so out of it. You didn’t know just
      how I felt about it, but you see Matthew did. Matthew understands me, and
      it’s so nice to be understood, Marilla.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Anne was too excited to do herself justice as to lessons that morning in
      school. Gilbert Blythe spelled her down in class and left her clear out of
      sight in mental arithmetic. Anne’s consequent humiliation was less than
      it might have been, however, in view of the concert and the spare-room bed. She
      and Diana talked so constantly about it all day that with a stricter teacher
      than Mr. Phillips dire disgrace must inevitably have been their portion.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Anne felt that she could not have borne it if she had not been going to the
      concert, for nothing else was discussed that day in school. The Avonlea
      Debating Club, which met fortnightly all winter, had had several smaller free
      entertainments; but this was to be a big affair, admission ten cents, in aid of
      the library. The Avonlea young people had been practicing for weeks, and all
      the scholars were especially interested in it by reason of older brothers and
      sisters who were going to take part. Everybody in school over nine years of age
      expected to go, except Carrie Sloane, whose father shared Marilla’s
      opinions about small girls going out to night concerts. Carrie Sloane cried
      into her grammar all the afternoon and felt that life was not worth living.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      For Anne the real excitement began with the dismissal of school and increased
      therefrom in crescendo until it reached to a crash of positive ecstasy in the
      concert itself. They had a “perfectly elegant tea;” and then came
      the delicious occupation of dressing in Diana’s little room upstairs.
      Diana did Anne’s front hair in the new pompadour style and Anne tied
      Diana’s bows with the especial knack she possessed; and they experimented
      with at least half a dozen different ways of arranging their back hair. At last
      they were ready, cheeks scarlet and eyes glowing with excitement.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      True, Anne could not help a little pang when she contrasted her plain black tam
      and shapeless, tight-sleeved, homemade gray-cloth coat with Diana’s
      jaunty fur cap and smart little jacket. But she remembered in time that she had
      an imagination and could use it.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Then Diana’s cousins, the Murrays from Newbridge, came; they all crowded
      into the big pung sleigh, among straw and furry robes. Anne reveled in the
      drive to the hall, slipping along over the satin-smooth roads with the snow
      crisping under the runners. There was a magnificent sunset, and the snowy hills
      and deep-blue water of the St. Lawrence Gulf seemed to rim in the splendor like
      a huge bowl of pearl and sapphire brimmed with wine and fire. Tinkles of sleigh
      bells and distant laughter, that seemed like the mirth of wood elves, came from
      every quarter.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Oh, Diana,” breathed Anne, squeezing Diana’s mittened hand
      under the fur robe, “isn’t it all like a beautiful dream? Do I
      really look the same as usual? I feel so different that it seems to me it must
      show in my looks.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “You look awfully nice,” said Diana, who having just received a
      compliment from one of her cousins, felt that she ought to pass it on.
      “You’ve got the loveliest color.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The program that night was a series of “thrills” for at least one
      listener in the audience, and, as Anne assured Diana, every succeeding thrill
      was thrillier than the last. When Prissy Andrews, attired in a new pink-silk
      waist with a string of pearls about her smooth white throat and real carnations
      in her hair—rumor whispered that the master had sent all the way to town
      for them for her—“climbed the slimy ladder, dark without one ray of
      light,” Anne shivered in luxurious sympathy; when the choir sang
      “Far Above the Gentle Daisies” Anne gazed at the ceiling as if it
      were frescoed with angels; when Sam Sloane proceeded to explain and illustrate
      “How Sockery Set a Hen” Anne laughed until people sitting near her
      laughed too, more out of sympathy with her than with amusement at a selection
      that was rather threadbare even in Avonlea; and when Mr. Phillips gave Mark
      Antony’s oration over the dead body of Cæsar in the most heart-stirring
      tones—looking at Prissy Andrews at the end of every sentence—Anne
      felt that she could rise and mutiny on the spot if but one Roman citizen led
      the way.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Only one number on the program failed to interest her. When Gilbert Blythe
      recited “Bingen on the Rhine” Anne picked up Rhoda Murray’s
      library book and read it until he had finished, when she sat rigidly stiff and
      motionless while Diana clapped her hands until they tingled.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      It was eleven when they got home, sated with dissipation, but with the
      exceeding sweet pleasure of talking it all over still to come. Everybody seemed
      asleep and the house was dark and silent. Anne and Diana tiptoed into the
      parlor, a long narrow room out of which the spare room opened. It was
      pleasantly warm and dimly lighted by the embers of a fire in the grate.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Let’s undress here,” said Diana. “It’s so nice
      and warm.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Hasn’t it been a delightful time?” sighed Anne rapturously.
      “It must be splendid to get up and recite there. Do you suppose we will
      ever be asked to do it, Diana?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Yes, of course, someday. They’re always wanting the big scholars
      to recite. Gilbert Blythe does often and he’s only two years older than
      us. Oh, Anne, how could you pretend not to listen to him? When he came to the
      line,
    </p>
    
    <p class="poem">
      ‘There’s Another, <i>not</i> a sister,’
    </p>
    
    <p class="noindent">
      he looked right down at you.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Diana,” said Anne with dignity, “you are my bosom friend,
      but I cannot allow even you to speak to me of that person. Are you ready for
      bed? Let’s run a race and see who’ll get to the bed first.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The suggestion appealed to Diana. The two little white-clad figures flew down
      the long room, through the spare-room door, and bounded on the bed at the same
      moment. And then—something—moved beneath them, there was a gasp and
      a cry—and somebody said in muffled accents:
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Merciful goodness!”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Anne and Diana were never able to tell just how they got off that bed and out
      of the room. They only knew that after one frantic rush they found themselves
      tiptoeing shiveringly upstairs.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Oh, who was it—<i>what</i> was it?” whispered Anne, her
      teeth chattering with cold and fright.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “It was Aunt Josephine,” said Diana, gasping with laughter.
      “Oh, Anne, it was Aunt Josephine, however she came to be there. Oh, and I
      know she will be furious. It’s dreadful—it’s really
      dreadful—but did you ever know anything so funny, Anne?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Who is your Aunt Josephine?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “She’s father’s aunt and she lives in Charlottetown.
      She’s awfully old—seventy anyhow—and I don’t believe
      she was <i>ever</i> a little girl. We were expecting her out for a visit, but
      not so soon. She’s awfully prim and proper and she’ll scold
      dreadfully about this, I know. Well, we’ll have to sleep with Minnie
      May—and you can’t think how she kicks.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Miss Josephine Barry did not appear at the early breakfast the next morning.
      Mrs. Barry smiled kindly at the two little girls.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Did you have a good time last night? I tried to stay awake until you
      came home, for I wanted to tell you Aunt Josephine had come and that you would
      have to go upstairs after all, but I was so tired I fell asleep. I hope you
      didn’t disturb your aunt, Diana.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Diana preserved a discreet silence, but she and Anne exchanged furtive smiles
      of guilty amusement across the table. Anne hurried home after breakfast and so
      remained in blissful ignorance of the disturbance which presently resulted in
      the Barry household until the late afternoon, when she went down to Mrs.
      Lynde’s on an errand for Marilla.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “So you and Diana nearly frightened poor old Miss Barry to death last
      night?” said Mrs. Lynde severely, but with a twinkle in her eye.
      “Mrs. Barry was here a few minutes ago on her way to Carmody. She’s
      feeling real worried over it. Old Miss Barry was in a terrible temper when she
      got up this morning—and Josephine Barry’s temper is no joke, I can
      tell you that. She wouldn’t speak to Diana at all.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “It wasn’t Diana’s fault,” said Anne contritely.
      “It was mine. I suggested racing to see who would get into bed
      first.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I knew it!” said Mrs. Lynde, with the exultation of a correct
      guesser. “I knew that idea came out of your head. Well, it’s made a
      nice lot of trouble, that’s what. Old Miss Barry came out to stay for a
      month, but she declares she won’t stay another day and is going right
      back to town tomorrow, Sunday and all as it is. She’d have gone today if
      they could have taken her. She had promised to pay for a quarter’s music
      lessons for Diana, but now she is determined to do nothing at all for such a
      tomboy. Oh, I guess they had a lively time of it there this morning. The Barrys
      must feel cut up. Old Miss Barry is rich and they’d like to keep on the
      good side of her. Of course, Mrs. Barry didn’t say just that to me, but
      I’m a pretty good judge of human nature, that’s what.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I’m such an unlucky girl,” mourned Anne. “I’m
      always getting into scrapes myself and getting my best friends—people
      I’d shed my heart’s blood for—into them too. Can you tell me
      why it is so, Mrs. Lynde?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “It’s because you’re too heedless and impulsive, child,
      that’s what. You never stop to think—whatever comes into your head
      to say or do you say or do it without a moment’s reflection.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Oh, but that’s the best of it,” protested Anne.
      “Something just flashes into your mind, so exciting, and you must out
      with it. If you stop to think it over you spoil it all. Haven’t you never
      felt that yourself, Mrs. Lynde?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      No, Mrs. Lynde had not. She shook her head sagely.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “You must learn to think a little, Anne, that’s what. The proverb
      you need to go by is ‘Look before you leap’—especially into
      spare-room beds.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Mrs. Lynde laughed comfortably over her mild joke, but Anne remained pensive.
      She saw nothing to laugh at in the situation, which to her eyes appeared very
      serious. When she left Mrs. Lynde’s she took her way across the crusted
      fields to Orchard Slope. Diana met her at the kitchen door.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Your Aunt Josephine was very cross about it, wasn’t she?”
      whispered Anne.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Yes,” answered Diana, stifling a giggle with an apprehensive
      glance over her shoulder at the closed sitting-room door. “She was fairly
      dancing with rage, Anne. Oh, how she scolded. She said I was the worst-behaved
      girl she ever saw and that my parents ought to be ashamed of the way they had
      brought me up. She says she won’t stay and I’m sure I don’t
      care. But Father and Mother do.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Why didn’t you tell them it was my fault?” demanded Anne.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “It’s likely I’d do such a thing, isn’t it?” said
      Diana with just scorn. “I’m no telltale, Anne Shirley, and anyhow I
      was just as much to blame as you.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Well, I’m going in to tell her myself,” said Anne
      resolutely.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Diana stared.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Anne Shirley, you’d never! why—she’ll eat you
      alive!”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Don’t frighten me any more than I am frightened,” implored
      Anne. “I’d rather walk up to a cannon’s mouth. But I’ve
      got to do it, Diana. It was my fault and I’ve got to confess. I’ve
      had practice in confessing, fortunately.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Well, she’s in the room,” said Diana. “You can go in
      if you want to. I wouldn’t dare. And I don’t believe you’ll
      do a bit of good.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      With this encouragement Anne bearded the lion in its den—that is to say,
      walked resolutely up to the sitting-room door and knocked faintly. A sharp
      “Come in” followed.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Miss Josephine Barry, thin, prim, and rigid, was knitting fiercely by the fire,
      her wrath quite unappeased and her eyes snapping through her gold-rimmed
      glasses. She wheeled around in her chair, expecting to see Diana, and beheld a
      white-faced girl whose great eyes were brimmed up with a mixture of desperate
      courage and shrinking terror.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Who are you?” demanded Miss Josephine Barry, without ceremony.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I’m Anne of Green Gables,” said the small visitor
      tremulously, clasping her hands with her characteristic gesture, “and
      I’ve come to confess, if you please.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Confess what?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “That it was all my fault about jumping into bed on you last night. I
      suggested it. Diana would never have thought of such a thing, I am sure. Diana
      is a very ladylike girl, Miss Barry. So you must see how unjust it is to blame
      her.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Oh, I must, hey? I rather think Diana did her share of the jumping at
      least. Such carryings on in a respectable house!”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “But we were only in fun,” persisted Anne. “I think you ought
      to forgive us, Miss Barry, now that we’ve apologized. And anyhow, please
      forgive Diana and let her have her music lessons. Diana’s heart is set on
      her music lessons, Miss Barry, and I know too well what it is to set your heart
      on a thing and not get it. If you must be cross with anyone, be cross with me.
      I’ve been so used in my early days to having people cross at me that I
      can endure it much better than Diana can.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Much of the snap had gone out of the old lady’s eyes by this time and was
      replaced by a twinkle of amused interest. But she still said severely:
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I don’t think it is any excuse for you that you were only in fun.
      Little girls never indulged in that kind of fun when I was young. You
      don’t know what it is to be awakened out of a sound sleep, after a long
      and arduous journey, by two great girls coming bounce down on you.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I don’t <i>know</i>, but I can <i>imagine</i>,” said Anne
      eagerly. “I’m sure it must have been very disturbing. But then,
      there is our side of it too. Have you any imagination, Miss Barry? If you have,
      just put yourself in our place. We didn’t know there was anybody in that
      bed and you nearly scared us to death. It was simply awful the way we felt. And
      then we couldn’t sleep in the spare room after being promised. I suppose
      you are used to sleeping in spare rooms. But just imagine what you would feel
      like if you were a little orphan girl who had never had such an honor.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      All the snap had gone by this time. Miss Barry actually laughed—a sound
      which caused Diana, waiting in speechless anxiety in the kitchen outside, to
      give a great gasp of relief.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I’m afraid my imagination is a little rusty—it’s so
      long since I used it,” she said. “I dare say your claim to sympathy
      is just as strong as mine. It all depends on the way we look at it. Sit down
      here and tell me about yourself.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I am very sorry I can’t,” said Anne firmly. “I would
      like to, because you seem like an interesting lady, and you might even be a
      kindred spirit although you don’t look very much like it. But it is my
      duty to go home to Miss Marilla Cuthbert. Miss Marilla Cuthbert is a very kind
      lady who has taken me to bring up properly. She is doing her best, but it is
      very discouraging work. You must not blame her because I jumped on the bed. But
      before I go I do wish you would tell me if you will forgive Diana and stay just
      as long as you meant to in Avonlea.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I think perhaps I will if you will come over and talk to me
      occasionally,” said Miss Barry.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      That evening Miss Barry gave Diana a silver bangle bracelet and told the senior
      members of the household that she had unpacked her valise.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I’ve made up my mind to stay simply for the sake of getting better
      acquainted with that Anne-girl,” she said frankly. “She amuses me,
      and at my time of life an amusing person is a rarity.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Marilla’s only comment when she heard the story was, “I told you
      so.” This was for Matthew’s benefit.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Miss Barry stayed her month out and over. She was a more agreeable guest than
      usual, for Anne kept her in good humor. They became firm friends.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      When Miss Barry went away she said:
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Remember, you Anne-girl, when you come to town you’re to visit me
      and I’ll put you in my very sparest spare-room bed to sleep.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Miss Barry was a kindred spirit, after all,” Anne confided to
      Marilla. “You wouldn’t think so to look at her, but she is. You
      don’t find it right out at first, as in Matthew’s case, but after a
      while you come to see it. Kindred spirits are not so scarce as I used to think.
      It’s splendid to find out there are so many of them in the world.”

      CHAPTER XX.<br>
      A Good Imagination Gone Wrong</h2>
    
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">S</span>PRING had come once
      more to Green Gables—the beautiful capricious, reluctant Canadian spring,
      lingering along through April and May in a succession of sweet, fresh, chilly
      days, with pink sunsets and miracles of resurrection and growth. The maples in
      Lover’s Lane were red budded and little curly ferns pushed up around the
      Dryad’s Bubble. Away up in the barrens, behind Mr. Silas Sloane’s
      place, the Mayflowers blossomed out, pink and white stars of sweetness under
      their brown leaves. All the school girls and boys had one golden afternoon
      gathering them, coming home in the clear, echoing twilight with arms and
      baskets full of flowery spoil.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I’m so sorry for people who live in lands where there are no
      Mayflowers,” said Anne. “Diana says perhaps they have something
      better, but there couldn’t be anything better than Mayflowers, could
      there, Marilla? And Diana says if they don’t know what they are like they
      don’t miss them. But I think that is the saddest thing of all. I think it
      would be <i>tragic</i>, Marilla, not to know what Mayflowers are like and
      <i>not</i> to miss them. Do you know what I think Mayflowers are, Marilla? I
      think they must be the souls of the flowers that died last summer and this is
      their heaven. But we had a splendid time today, Marilla. We had our lunch down
      in a big mossy hollow by an old well—such a <i>romantic</i> spot. Charlie
      Sloane dared Arty Gillis to jump over it, and Arty did because he
      wouldn’t take a dare. Nobody would in school. It is very
      <i>fashionable</i> to dare. Mr. Phillips gave all the Mayflowers he found to
      Prissy Andrews and I heard him to say ‘sweets to the sweet.’ He got
      that out of a book, I know; but it shows he has some imagination. I was offered
      some Mayflowers too, but I rejected them with scorn. I can’t tell you the
      person’s name because I have vowed never to let it cross my lips. We made
      wreaths of the Mayflowers and put them on our hats; and when the time came to
      go home we marched in procession down the road, two by two, with our bouquets
      and wreaths, singing ‘My Home on the Hill.’ Oh, it was so
      thrilling, Marilla. All Mr. Silas Sloane’s folks rushed out to see us and
      everybody we met on the road stopped and stared after us. We made a real
      sensation.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Not much wonder! Such silly doings!” was Marilla’s response.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      After the Mayflowers came the violets, and Violet Vale was empurpled with them.
      Anne walked through it on her way to school with reverent steps and worshiping
      eyes, as if she trod on holy ground.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Somehow,” she told Diana, “when I’m going through here
      I don’t really care whether Gil—whether anybody gets ahead of me in
      class or not. But when I’m up in school it’s all different and I
      care as much as ever. There’s such a lot of different Annes in me. I
      sometimes think that is why I’m such a troublesome person. If I was just
      the one Anne it would be ever so much more comfortable, but then it
      wouldn’t be half so interesting.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      One June evening, when the orchards were pink blossomed again, when the frogs
      were singing silverly sweet in the marshes about the head of the Lake of
      Shining Waters, and the air was full of the savor of clover fields and balsamic
      fir woods, Anne was sitting by her gable window. She had been studying her
      lessons, but it had grown too dark to see the book, so she had fallen into
      wide-eyed reverie, looking out past the boughs of the Snow Queen, once more
      bestarred with its tufts of blossom.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      In all essential respects the little gable chamber was unchanged. The walls
      were as white, the pincushion as hard, the chairs as stiffly and yellowly
      upright as ever. Yet the whole character of the room was altered. It was full
      of a new vital, pulsing personality that seemed to pervade it and to be quite
      independent of schoolgirl books and dresses and ribbons, and even of the
      cracked blue jug full of apple blossoms on the table. It was as if all the
      dreams, sleeping and waking, of its vivid occupant had taken a visible although
      unmaterial form and had tapestried the bare room with splendid filmy tissues of
      rainbow and moonshine. Presently Marilla came briskly in with some of
      Anne’s freshly ironed school aprons. She hung them over a chair and sat
      down with a short sigh. She had had one of her headaches that afternoon, and
      although the pain had gone she felt weak and “tuckered out,” as she
      expressed it. Anne looked at her with eyes limpid with sympathy.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I do truly wish I could have had the headache in your place, Marilla. I
      would have endured it joyfully for your sake.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I guess you did your part in attending to the work and letting me
      rest,” said Marilla. “You seem to have got on fairly well and made
      fewer mistakes than usual. Of course it wasn’t exactly necessary to
      starch Matthew’s handkerchiefs! And most people when they put a pie in
      the oven to warm up for dinner take it out and eat it when it gets hot instead
      of leaving it to be burned to a crisp. But that doesn’t seem to be your
      way evidently.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Headaches always left Marilla somewhat sarcastic.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Oh, I’m so sorry,” said Anne penitently. “I never
      thought about that pie from the moment I put it in the oven till now, although
      I felt <i>instinctively</i> that there was something missing on the dinner
      table. I was firmly resolved, when you left me in charge this morning, not to
      imagine anything, but keep my thoughts on facts. I did pretty well until I put
      the pie in, and then an irresistible temptation came to me to imagine I was an
      enchanted princess shut up in a lonely tower with a handsome knight riding to
      my rescue on a coal-black steed. So that is how I came to forget the pie. I
      didn’t know I starched the handkerchiefs. All the time I was ironing I
      was trying to think of a name for a new island Diana and I have discovered up
      the brook. It’s the most ravishing spot, Marilla. There are two maple
      trees on it and the brook flows right around it. At last it struck me that it
      would be splendid to call it Victoria Island because we found it on the
      Queen’s birthday. Both Diana and I are very loyal. But I’m sorry
      about that pie and the handkerchiefs. I wanted to be extra good today because
      it’s an anniversary. Do you remember what happened this day last year,
      Marilla?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “No, I can’t think of anything special.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Oh, Marilla, it was the day I came to Green Gables. I shall never forget
      it. It was the turning point in my life. Of course it wouldn’t seem so
      important to you. I’ve been here for a year and I’ve been so happy.
      Of course, I’ve had my troubles, but one can live down troubles. Are you
      sorry you kept me, Marilla?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “No, I can’t say I’m sorry,” said Marilla, who
      sometimes wondered how she could have lived before Anne came to Green Gables,
      “no, not exactly sorry. If you’ve finished your lessons, Anne, I
      want you to run over and ask Mrs. Barry if she’ll lend me Diana’s
      apron pattern.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Oh—it’s—it’s too dark,” cried Anne.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Too dark? Why, it’s only twilight. And goodness knows you’ve
      gone over often enough after dark.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I’ll go over early in the morning,” said Anne eagerly.
      “I’ll get up at sunrise and go over, Marilla.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “What has got into your head now, Anne Shirley? I want that pattern to
      cut out your new apron this evening. Go at once and be smart too.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I’ll have to go around by the road, then,” said Anne, taking
      up her hat reluctantly.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Go by the road and waste half an hour! I’d like to catch
      you!”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I can’t go through the Haunted Wood, Marilla,” cried Anne
      desperately.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Marilla stared.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “The Haunted Wood! Are you crazy? What under the canopy is the Haunted
      Wood?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “The spruce wood over the brook,” said Anne in a whisper.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Fiddlesticks! There is no such thing as a haunted wood anywhere. Who has
      been telling you such stuff?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Nobody,” confessed Anne. “Diana and I just imagined the wood
      was haunted. All the places around here are
      so—so—<i>commonplace</i>. We just got this up for our own
      amusement. We began it in April. A haunted wood is so very romantic, Marilla.
      We chose the spruce grove because it’s so gloomy. Oh, we have imagined
      the most harrowing things. There’s a white lady walks along the brook
      just about this time of the night and wrings her hands and utters wailing
      cries. She appears when there is to be a death in the family. And the ghost of
      a little murdered child haunts the corner up by Idlewild; it creeps up behind
      you and lays its cold fingers on your hand—so. Oh, Marilla, it gives me a
      shudder to think of it. And there’s a headless man stalks up and down the
      path and skeletons glower at you between the boughs. Oh, Marilla, I
      wouldn’t go through the Haunted Wood after dark now for anything.
      I’d be sure that white things would reach out from behind the trees and
      grab me.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Did ever anyone hear the like!” ejaculated Marilla, who had
      listened in dumb amazement. “Anne Shirley, do you mean to tell me you
      believe all that wicked nonsense of your own imagination?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Not believe <i>exactly</i>,” faltered Anne. “At least, I
      don’t believe it in daylight. But after dark, Marilla, it’s
      different. That is when ghosts walk.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “There are no such things as ghosts, Anne.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Oh, but there are, Marilla,” cried Anne eagerly. “I know
      people who have seen them. And they are respectable people. Charlie Sloane says
      that his grandmother saw his grandfather driving home the cows one night after
      he’d been buried for a year. You know Charlie Sloane’s grandmother
      wouldn’t tell a story for anything. She’s a very religious woman.
      And Mrs. Thomas’s father was pursued home one night by a lamb of fire
      with its head cut off hanging by a strip of skin. He said he knew it was the
      spirit of his brother and that it was a warning he would die within nine days.
      He didn’t, but he died two years after, so you see it was really true.
      And Ruby Gillis says—”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Anne Shirley,” interrupted Marilla firmly, “I never want to
      hear you talking in this fashion again. I’ve had my doubts about that
      imagination of yours right along, and if this is going to be the outcome of it,
      I won’t countenance any such doings. You’ll go right over to
      Barry’s, and you’ll go through that spruce grove, just for a lesson
      and a warning to you. And never let me hear a word out of your head about
      haunted woods again.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Anne might plead and cry as she liked—and did, for her terror was very
      real. Her imagination had run away with her and she held the spruce grove in
      mortal dread after nightfall. But Marilla was inexorable. She marched the
      shrinking ghost-seer down to the spring and ordered her to proceed straightway
      over the bridge and into the dusky retreats of wailing ladies and headless
      specters beyond.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Oh, Marilla, how can you be so cruel?” sobbed Anne. “What
      would you feel like if a white thing did snatch me up and carry me off?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I’ll risk it,” said Marilla unfeelingly. “You know I
      always mean what I say. I’ll cure you of imagining ghosts into places.
      March, now.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Anne marched. That is, she stumbled over the bridge and went shuddering up the
      horrible dim path beyond. Anne never forgot that walk. Bitterly did she repent
      the license she had given to her imagination. The goblins of her fancy lurked
      in every shadow about her, reaching out their cold, fleshless hands to grasp
      the terrified small girl who had called them into being. A white strip of birch
      bark blowing up from the hollow over the brown floor of the grove made her
      heart stand still. The long-drawn wail of two old boughs rubbing against each
      other brought out the perspiration in beads on her forehead. The swoop of bats
      in the darkness over her was as the wings of unearthly creatures. When she
      reached Mr. William Bell’s field she fled across it as if pursued by an
      army of white things, and arrived at the Barry kitchen door so out of breath
      that she could hardly gasp out her request for the apron pattern. Diana was
      away so that she had no excuse to linger. The dreadful return journey had to be
      faced. Anne went back over it with shut eyes, preferring to take the risk of
      dashing her brains out among the boughs to that of seeing a white thing. When
      she finally stumbled over the log bridge she drew one long shivering breath of
      relief.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Well, so nothing caught you?” said Marilla unsympathetically.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Oh, Mar—Marilla,” chattered Anne, “I’ll b-b-be
      contt-tented with c-c-commonplace places after this.”

    <h2><a id="link2HCH0021"></a>
      CHAPTER XXI.<br>
      A New Departure in Flavorings</h2>
    
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">D</span>EAR me, there is
      nothing but meetings and partings in this world, as Mrs. Lynde says,”
      remarked Anne plaintively, putting her slate and books down on the kitchen
      table on the last day of June and wiping her red eyes with a very damp
      handkerchief. “Wasn’t it fortunate, Marilla, that I took an extra
      handkerchief to school today? I had a presentiment that it would be
      needed.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I never thought you were so fond of Mr. Phillips that you’d
      require two handkerchiefs to dry your tears just because he was going
      away,” said Marilla.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I don’t think I was crying because I was really so very fond of
      him,” reflected Anne. “I just cried because all the others did. It
      was Ruby Gillis started it. Ruby Gillis has always declared she hated Mr.
      Phillips, but just as soon as he got up to make his farewell speech she burst
      into tears. Then all the girls began to cry, one after the other. I tried to
      hold out, Marilla. I tried to remember the time Mr. Phillips made me sit with
      Gil—with a boy; and the time he spelled my name without an
      ‘e’ on the blackboard; and how he said I was the worst dunce he
      ever saw at geometry and laughed at my spelling; and all the times he had been
      so horrid and sarcastic; but somehow I couldn’t, Marilla, and I just had
      to cry too. Jane Andrews has been talking for a month about how glad
      she’d be when Mr. Phillips went away and she declared she’d never
      shed a tear. Well, she was worse than any of us and had to borrow a
      handkerchief from her brother—of course the boys didn’t
      cry—because she hadn’t brought one of her own, not expecting to
      need it. Oh, Marilla, it was heartrending. Mr. Phillips made such a beautiful
      farewell speech beginning, ‘The time has come for us to part.’ It
      was very affecting. And he had tears in his eyes too, Marilla. Oh, I felt
      dreadfully sorry and remorseful for all the times I’d talked in school
      and drawn pictures of him on my slate and made fun of him and Prissy. I can
      tell you I wished I’d been a model pupil like Minnie Andrews. She
      hadn’t anything on her conscience. The girls cried all the way home from
      school. Carrie Sloane kept saying every few minutes, ‘The time has come
      for us to part,’ and that would start us off again whenever we were in
      any danger of cheering up. I do feel dreadfully sad, Marilla. But one
      can’t feel quite in the depths of despair with two months’ vacation
      before them, can they, Marilla? And besides, we met the new minister and his
      wife coming from the station. For all I was feeling so bad about Mr. Phillips
      going away I couldn’t help taking a little interest in a new minister,
      could I? His wife is very pretty. Not exactly regally lovely, of
      course—it wouldn’t do, I suppose, for a minister to have a regally
      lovely wife, because it might set a bad example. Mrs. Lynde says the
      minister’s wife over at Newbridge sets a very bad example because she
      dresses so fashionably. Our new minister’s wife was dressed in blue
      muslin with lovely puffed sleeves and a hat trimmed with roses. Jane Andrews
      said she thought puffed sleeves were too worldly for a minister’s wife,
      but I didn’t make any such uncharitable remark, Marilla, because I know
      what it is to long for puffed sleeves. Besides, she’s only been a
      minister’s wife for a little while, so one should make allowances,
      shouldn’t they? They are going to board with Mrs. Lynde until the manse
      is ready.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      If Marilla, in going down to Mrs. Lynde’s that evening, was actuated by
      any motive save her avowed one of returning the quilting frames she had
      borrowed the preceding winter, it was an amiable weakness shared by most of the
      Avonlea people. Many a thing Mrs. Lynde had lent, sometimes never expecting to
      see it again, came home that night in charge of the borrowers thereof. A new
      minister, and moreover a minister with a wife, was a lawful object of curiosity
      in a quiet little country settlement where sensations were few and far between.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Old Mr. Bentley, the minister whom Anne had found lacking in imagination, had
      been pastor of Avonlea for eighteen years. He was a widower when he came, and a
      widower he remained, despite the fact that gossip regularly married him to
      this, that, or the other one, every year of his sojourn. In the preceding
      February he had resigned his charge and departed amid the regrets of his
      people, most of whom had the affection born of long intercourse for their good
      old minister in spite of his shortcomings as an orator. Since then the Avonlea
      church had enjoyed a variety of religious dissipation in listening to the many
      and various candidates and “supplies” who came Sunday after Sunday
      to preach on trial. These stood or fell by the judgment of the fathers and
      mothers in Israel; but a certain small, red-haired girl who sat meekly in the
      corner of the old Cuthbert pew also had her opinions about them and discussed
      the same in full with Matthew, Marilla always declining from principle to
      criticize ministers in any shape or form.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I don’t think Mr. Smith would have done, Matthew” was
      Anne’s final summing up. “Mrs. Lynde says his delivery was so poor,
      but I think his worst fault was just like Mr. Bentley’s—he had no
      imagination. And Mr. Terry had too much; he let it run away with him just as I
      did mine in the matter of the Haunted Wood. Besides, Mrs. Lynde says his
      theology wasn’t sound. Mr. Gresham was a very good man and a very
      religious man, but he told too many funny stories and made the people laugh in
      church; he was undignified, and you must have some dignity about a minister,
      mustn’t you, Matthew? I thought Mr. Marshall was decidedly attractive;
      but Mrs. Lynde says he isn’t married, or even engaged, because she made
      special inquiries about him, and she says it would never do to have a young
      unmarried minister in Avonlea, because he might marry in the congregation and
      that would make trouble. Mrs. Lynde is a very farseeing woman, isn’t she,
      Matthew? I’m very glad they’ve called Mr. Allan. I liked him
      because his sermon was interesting and he prayed as if he meant it and not just
      as if he did it because he was in the habit of it. Mrs. Lynde says he
      isn’t perfect, but she says she supposes we couldn’t expect a
      perfect minister for seven hundred and fifty dollars a year, and anyhow his
      theology is sound because she questioned him thoroughly on all the points of
      doctrine. And she knows his wife’s people and they are most respectable
      and the women are all good housekeepers. Mrs. Lynde says that sound doctrine in
      the man and good housekeeping in the woman make an ideal combination for a
      minister’s family.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The new minister and his wife were a young, pleasant-faced couple, still on
      their honeymoon, and full of all good and beautiful enthusiasms for their
      chosen lifework. Avonlea opened its heart to them from the start. Old and young
      liked the frank, cheerful young man with his high ideals, and the bright,
      gentle little lady who assumed the mistress-ship of the manse. With Mrs. Allan
      Anne fell promptly and wholeheartedly in love. She had discovered another
      kindred spirit.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Mrs. Allan is perfectly lovely,” she announced one Sunday
      afternoon. “She’s taken our class and she’s a splendid
      teacher. She said right away she didn’t think it was fair for the teacher
      to ask all the questions, and you know, Marilla, that is exactly what
      I’ve always thought. She said we could ask her any question we liked and
      I asked ever so many. I’m good at asking questions, Marilla.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I believe you,” was Marilla’s emphatic comment.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Nobody else asked any except Ruby Gillis, and she asked if there was to
      be a Sunday-school picnic this summer. I didn’t think that was a very
      proper question to ask because it hadn’t any connection with the
      lesson—the lesson was about Daniel in the lions’ den—but Mrs.
      Allan just smiled and said she thought there would be. Mrs. Allan has a lovely
      smile; she has such <i>exquisite</i> dimples in her cheeks. I wish I had
      dimples in my cheeks, Marilla. I’m not half so skinny as I was when I
      came here, but I have no dimples yet. If I had perhaps I could influence people
      for good. Mrs. Allan said we ought always to try to influence other people for
      good. She talked so nice about everything. I never knew before that religion
      was such a cheerful thing. I always thought it was kind of melancholy, but Mrs.
      Allan’s isn’t, and I’d like to be a Christian if I could be
      one like her. I wouldn’t want to be one like Mr. Superintendent
      Bell.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “It’s very naughty of you to speak so about Mr. Bell,” said
      Marilla severely. “Mr. Bell is a real good man.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Oh, of course he’s good,” agreed Anne, “but he
      doesn’t seem to get any comfort out of it. If I could be good I’d
      dance and sing all day because I was glad of it. I suppose Mrs. Allan is too
      old to dance and sing and of course it wouldn’t be dignified in a
      minister’s wife. But I can just feel she’s glad she’s a
      Christian and that she’d be one even if she could get to heaven without
      it.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I suppose we must have Mr. and Mrs. Allan up to tea someday soon,”
      said Marilla reflectively. “They’ve been most everywhere but here.
      Let me see. Next Wednesday would be a good time to have them. But don’t
      say a word to Matthew about it, for if he knew they were coming he’d find
      some excuse to be away that day. He’d got so used to Mr. Bentley he
      didn’t mind him, but he’s going to find it hard to get acquainted
      with a new minister, and a new minister’s wife will frighten him to
      death.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I’ll be as secret as the dead,” assured Anne. “But oh,
      Marilla, will you let me make a cake for the occasion? I’d love to do
      something for Mrs. Allan, and you know I can make a pretty good cake by this
      time.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “You can make a layer cake,” promised Marilla.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Monday and Tuesday great preparations went on at Green Gables. Having the
      minister and his wife to tea was a serious and important undertaking, and
      Marilla was determined not to be eclipsed by any of the Avonlea housekeepers.
      Anne was wild with excitement and delight. She talked it all over with Diana
      Tuesday night in the twilight, as they sat on the big red stones by the
      Dryad’s Bubble and made rainbows in the water with little twigs dipped in
      fir balsam.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Everything is ready, Diana, except my cake which I’m to make in
      the morning, and the baking-powder biscuits which Marilla will make just before
      teatime. I assure you, Diana, that Marilla and I have had a busy two days of
      it. It’s such a responsibility having a minister’s family to tea. I
      never went through such an experience before. You should just see our pantry.
      It’s a sight to behold. We’re going to have jellied chicken and
      cold tongue. We’re to have two kinds of jelly, red and yellow, and
      whipped cream and lemon pie, and cherry pie, and three kinds of cookies, and
      fruit cake, and Marilla’s famous yellow plum preserves that she keeps
      especially for ministers, and pound cake and layer cake, and biscuits as
      aforesaid; and new bread and old both, in case the minister is dyspeptic and
      can’t eat new. Mrs. Lynde says ministers are dyspeptic, but I don’t
      think Mr. Allan has been a minister long enough for it to have had a bad effect
      on him. I just grow cold when I think of my layer cake. Oh, Diana, what if it
      shouldn’t be good! I dreamed last night that I was chased all around by a
      fearful goblin with a big layer cake for a head.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “It’ll be good, all right,” assured Diana, who was a very
      comfortable sort of friend. “I’m sure that piece of the one you
      made that we had for lunch in Idlewild two weeks ago was perfectly
      elegant.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Yes; but cakes have such a terrible habit of turning out bad just when
      you especially want them to be good,” sighed Anne, setting a particularly
      well-balsamed twig afloat. “However, I suppose I shall just have to trust
      to Providence and be careful to put in the flour. Oh, look, Diana, what a
      lovely rainbow! Do you suppose the dryad will come out after we go away and
      take it for a scarf?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “You know there is no such thing as a dryad,” said Diana.
      Diana’s mother had found out about the Haunted Wood and had been
      decidedly angry over it. As a result Diana had abstained from any further
      imitative flights of imagination and did not think it prudent to cultivate a
      spirit of belief even in harmless dryads.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “But it’s so easy to imagine there is,” said Anne.
      “Every night before I go to bed, I look out of my window and wonder if
      the dryad is really sitting here, combing her locks with the spring for a
      mirror. Sometimes I look for her footprints in the dew in the morning. Oh,
      Diana, don’t give up your faith in the dryad!”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Wednesday morning came. Anne got up at sunrise because she was too excited to
      sleep. She had caught a severe cold in the head by reason of her dabbling in
      the spring on the preceding evening; but nothing short of absolute pneumonia
      could have quenched her interest in culinary matters that morning. After
      breakfast she proceeded to make her cake. When she finally shut the oven door
      upon it she drew a long breath.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I’m sure I haven’t forgotten anything this time, Marilla.
      But do you think it will rise? Just suppose perhaps the baking powder
      isn’t good? I used it out of the new can. And Mrs. Lynde says you can
      never be sure of getting good baking powder nowadays when everything is so
      adulterated. Mrs. Lynde says the Government ought to take the matter up, but
      she says we’ll never see the day when a Tory Government will do it.
      Marilla, what if that cake doesn’t rise?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “We’ll have plenty without it” was Marilla’s
      unimpassioned way of looking at the subject.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The cake did rise, however, and came out of the oven as light and feathery as
      golden foam. Anne, flushed with delight, clapped it together with layers of
      ruby jelly and, in imagination, saw Mrs. Allan eating it and possibly asking
      for another piece!
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “You’ll be using the best tea set, of course, Marilla,” she
      said. “Can I fix the table with ferns and wild roses?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I think that’s all nonsense,” sniffed Marilla. “In my
      opinion it’s the eatables that matter and not flummery
      decorations.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Mrs. Barry had <i>her</i> table decorated,” said Anne, who was not
      entirely guiltless of the wisdom of the serpent, “and the minister paid
      her an elegant compliment. He said it was a feast for the eye as well as the
      palate.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Well, do as you like,” said Marilla, who was quite determined not
      to be surpassed by Mrs. Barry or anybody else. “Only mind you leave
      enough room for the dishes and the food.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Anne laid herself out to decorate in a manner and after a fashion that should
      leave Mrs. Barry’s nowhere. Having abundance of roses and ferns and a
      very artistic taste of her own, she made that tea table such a thing of beauty
      that when the minister and his wife sat down to it they exclaimed in chorus
      over it loveliness.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “It’s Anne’s doings,” said Marilla, grimly just; and
      Anne felt that Mrs. Allan’s approving smile was almost too much happiness
      for this world.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Matthew was there, having been inveigled into the party only goodness and Anne
      knew how. He had been in such a state of shyness and nervousness that Marilla
      had given him up in despair, but Anne took him in hand so successfully that he
      now sat at the table in his best clothes and white collar and talked to the
      minister not uninterestingly. He never said a word to Mrs. Allan, but that
      perhaps was not to be expected.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      All went merry as a marriage bell until Anne’s layer cake was passed.
      Mrs. Allan, having already been helped to a bewildering variety, declined it.
      But Marilla, seeing the disappointment on Anne’s face, said smilingly:
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Oh, you must take a piece of this, Mrs. Allan. Anne made it on purpose
      for you.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “In that case I must sample it,” laughed Mrs. Allan, helping
      herself to a plump triangle, as did also the minister and Marilla.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Mrs. Allan took a mouthful of hers and a most peculiar expression crossed her
      face; not a word did she say, however, but steadily ate away at it. Marilla saw
      the expression and hastened to taste the cake.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Anne Shirley!” she exclaimed, “what on earth did you put
      into that cake?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Nothing but what the recipe said, Marilla,” cried Anne with a look
      of anguish. “Oh, isn’t it all right?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “All right! It’s simply horrible. Mr. Allan, don’t try to eat
      it. Anne, taste it yourself. What flavoring did you use?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Vanilla,” said Anne, her face scarlet with mortification after
      tasting the cake. “Only vanilla. Oh, Marilla, it must have been the
      baking powder. I had my suspicions of that bak—”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Baking powder fiddlesticks! Go and bring me the bottle of vanilla you
      used.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Anne fled to the pantry and returned with a small bottle partially filled with
      a brown liquid and labeled yellowly, “Best Vanilla.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Marilla took it, uncorked it, smelled it.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Mercy on us, Anne, you’ve flavored that cake with <i>Anodyne
        Liniment</i>. I broke the liniment bottle last week and poured what was left
      into an old empty vanilla bottle. I suppose it’s partly my fault—I
      should have warned you—but for pity’s sake why couldn’t you
      have smelled it?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Anne dissolved into tears under this double disgrace.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I couldn’t—I had such a cold!” and with this she
      fairly fled to the gable chamber, where she cast herself on the bed and wept as
      one who refuses to be comforted.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Presently a light step sounded on the stairs and somebody entered the room.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Oh, Marilla,” sobbed Anne, without looking up, “I’m
      disgraced forever. I shall never be able to live this down. It will get
      out—things always do get out in Avonlea. Diana will ask me how my cake
      turned out and I shall have to tell her the truth. I shall always be pointed at
      as the girl who flavored a cake with anodyne liniment. Gil—the boys in
      school will never get over laughing at it. Oh, Marilla, if you have a spark of
      Christian pity don’t tell me that I must go down and wash the dishes
      after this. I’ll wash them when the minister and his wife are gone, but I
      cannot ever look Mrs. Allan in the face again. Perhaps she’ll think I
      tried to poison her. Mrs. Lynde says she knows an orphan girl who tried to
      poison her benefactor. But the liniment isn’t poisonous. It’s meant
      to be taken internally—although not in cakes. Won’t you tell Mrs.
      Allan so, Marilla?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Suppose you jump up and tell her so yourself,” said a merry voice.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Anne flew up, to find Mrs. Allan standing by her bed, surveying her with
      laughing eyes.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “My dear little girl, you mustn’t cry like this,” she said,
      genuinely disturbed by Anne’s tragic face. “Why, it’s all
      just a funny mistake that anybody might make.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Oh, no, it takes me to make such a mistake,” said Anne forlornly.
      “And I wanted to have that cake so nice for you, Mrs. Allan.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Yes, I know, dear. And I assure you I appreciate your kindness and
      thoughtfulness just as much as if it had turned out all right. Now, you
      mustn’t cry any more, but come down with me and show me your flower
      garden. Miss Cuthbert tells me you have a little plot all your own. I want to
      see it, for I’m very much interested in flowers.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Anne permitted herself to be led down and comforted, reflecting that it was
      really providential that Mrs. Allan was a kindred spirit. Nothing more was said
      about the liniment cake, and when the guests went away Anne found that she had
      enjoyed the evening more than could have been expected, considering that
      terrible incident. Nevertheless, she sighed deeply.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Marilla, isn’t it nice to think that tomorrow is a new day with no
      mistakes in it yet?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I’ll warrant you’ll make plenty in it,” said Marilla.
      “I never saw your beat for making mistakes, Anne.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Yes, and well I know it,” admitted Anne mournfully. “But
      have you ever noticed one encouraging thing about me, Marilla? I never make the
      same mistake twice.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I don’t know as that’s much benefit when you’re always
      making new ones.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Oh, don’t you see, Marilla? There must be a limit to the mistakes
      one person can make, and when I get to the end of them, then I’ll be
      through with them. That’s a very comforting thought.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Well, you’d better go and give that cake to the pigs,” said
      Marilla. “It isn’t fit for any human to eat, not even Jerry
      Boute.”

      CHAPTER XXII.<br>
      Anne Is Invited Out to Tea</h2>
    
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>ND what are your eyes
      popping out of your head about. Now?” asked Marilla, when Anne had just
      come in from a run to the post office. “Have you discovered another
      kindred spirit?” Excitement hung around Anne like a garment, shone in her
      eyes, kindled in every feature. She had come dancing up the lane, like a
      wind-blown sprite, through the mellow sunshine and lazy shadows of the August
      evening.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “No, Marilla, but oh, what do you think? I am invited to tea at the manse
      tomorrow afternoon! Mrs. Allan left the letter for me at the post office. Just
      look at it, Marilla. ‘Miss Anne Shirley, Green Gables.’ That is the
      first time I was ever called ‘Miss.’ Such a thrill as it gave me! I
      shall cherish it forever among my choicest treasures.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Mrs. Allan told me she meant to have all the members of her
      Sunday-school class to tea in turn,” said Marilla, regarding the
      wonderful event very coolly. “You needn’t get in such a fever over
      it. Do learn to take things calmly, child.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      For Anne to take things calmly would have been to change her nature. All
      “spirit and fire and dew,” as she was, the pleasures and pains of
      life came to her with trebled intensity. Marilla felt this and was vaguely
      troubled over it, realizing that the ups and downs of existence would probably
      bear hardly on this impulsive soul and not sufficiently understanding that the
      equally great capacity for delight might more than compensate. Therefore
      Marilla conceived it to be her duty to drill Anne into a tranquil uniformity of
      disposition as impossible and alien to her as to a dancing sunbeam in one of
      the brook shallows. She did not make much headway, as she sorrowfully admitted
      to herself. The downfall of some dear hope or plan plunged Anne into
      “deeps of affliction.” The fulfillment thereof exalted her to dizzy
      realms of delight. Marilla had almost begun to despair of ever fashioning this
      waif of the world into her model little girl of demure manners and prim
      deportment. Neither would she have believed that she really liked Anne much
      better as she was.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Anne went to bed that night speechless with misery because Matthew had said the
      wind was round northeast and he feared it would be a rainy day tomorrow. The
      rustle of the poplar leaves about the house worried her, it sounded so like
      pattering raindrops, and the full, faraway roar of the gulf, to which she
      listened delightedly at other times, loving its strange, sonorous, haunting
      rhythm, now seemed like a prophecy of storm and disaster to a small maiden who
      particularly wanted a fine day. Anne thought that the morning would never come.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      But all things have an end, even nights before the day on which you are invited
      to take tea at the manse. The morning, in spite of Matthew’s predictions,
      was fine and Anne’s spirits soared to their highest. “Oh, Marilla,
      there is something in me today that makes me just love everybody I see,”
      she exclaimed as she washed the breakfast dishes. “You don’t know
      how good I feel! Wouldn’t it be nice if it could last? I believe I could
      be a model child if I were just invited out to tea every day. But oh, Marilla,
      it’s a solemn occasion too. I feel so anxious. What if I shouldn’t
      behave properly? You know I never had tea at a manse before, and I’m not
      sure that I know all the rules of etiquette, although I’ve been studying
      the rules given in the Etiquette Department of the Family Herald ever since I
      came here. I’m so afraid I’ll do something silly or forget to do
      something I should do. Would it be good manners to take a second helping of
      anything if you wanted to <i>very</i> much?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “The trouble with you, Anne, is that you’re thinking too much about
      yourself. You should just think of Mrs. Allan and what would be nicest and most
      agreeable to her,” said Marilla, hitting for once in her life on a very
      sound and pithy piece of advice. Anne instantly realized this.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “You are right, Marilla. I’ll try not to think about myself at
      all.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Anne evidently got through her visit without any serious breach of
      “etiquette,” for she came home through the twilight, under a great,
      high-sprung sky gloried over with trails of saffron and rosy cloud, in a
      beatified state of mind and told Marilla all about it happily, sitting on the
      big red-sandstone slab at the kitchen door with her tired curly head in
      Marilla’s gingham lap.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      A cool wind was blowing down over the long harvest fields from the rims of
      firry western hills and whistling through the poplars. One clear star hung over
      the orchard and the fireflies were flitting over in Lover’s Lane, in and
      out among the ferns and rustling boughs. Anne watched them as she talked and
      somehow felt that wind and stars and fireflies were all tangled up together
      into something unutterably sweet and enchanting.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Oh, Marilla, I’ve had a most <i>fascinating</i> time. I feel that
      I have not lived in vain and I shall always feel like that even if I should
      never be invited to tea at a manse again. When I got there Mrs. Allan met me at
      the door. She was dressed in the sweetest dress of pale-pink organdy, with
      dozens of frills and elbow sleeves, and she looked just like a seraph. I really
      think I’d like to be a minister’s wife when I grow up, Marilla. A
      minister mightn’t mind my red hair because he wouldn’t be thinking
      of such worldly things. But then of course one would have to be naturally good
      and I’ll never be that, so I suppose there’s no use in thinking
      about it. Some people are naturally good, you know, and others are not.
      I’m one of the others. Mrs. Lynde says I’m full of original sin. No
      matter how hard I try to be good I can never make such a success of it as those
      who are naturally good. It’s a good deal like geometry, I expect. But
      don’t you think the trying so hard ought to count for something? Mrs.
      Allan is one of the naturally good people. I love her passionately. You know
      there are some people, like Matthew and Mrs. Allan that you can love right off
      without any trouble. And there are others, like Mrs. Lynde, that you have to
      try very hard to love. You know you <i>ought</i> to love them because they know
      so much and are such active workers in the church, but you have to keep
      reminding yourself of it all the time or else you forget. There was another
      little girl at the manse to tea, from the White Sands Sunday-school. Her name
      was Laurette Bradley, and she was a very nice little girl. Not exactly a
      kindred spirit, you know, but still very nice. We had an elegant tea, and I
      think I kept all the rules of etiquette pretty well. After tea Mrs. Allan
      played and sang and she got Lauretta and me to sing too. Mrs. Allan says I have
      a good voice and she says I must sing in the Sunday-school choir after this.
      You can’t think how I was thrilled at the mere thought. I’ve longed
      so to sing in the Sunday-school choir, as Diana does, but I feared it was an
      honor I could never aspire to. Lauretta had to go home early because there is a
      big concert in the White Sands Hotel tonight and her sister is to recite at it.
      Lauretta says that the Americans at the hotel give a concert every fortnight in
      aid of the Charlottetown hospital, and they ask lots of the White Sands people
      to recite. Lauretta said she expected to be asked herself someday. I just gazed
      at her in awe. After she had gone Mrs. Allan and I had a heart-to-heart talk. I
      told her everything—about Mrs. Thomas and the twins and Katie Maurice and
      Violetta and coming to Green Gables and my troubles over geometry. And would
      you believe it, Marilla? Mrs. Allan told me she was a dunce at geometry too.
      You don’t know how that encouraged me. Mrs. Lynde came to the manse just
      before I left, and what do you think, Marilla? The trustees have hired a new
      teacher and it’s a lady. Her name is Miss Muriel Stacy. Isn’t that
      a romantic name? Mrs. Lynde says they’ve never had a female teacher in
      Avonlea before and she thinks it is a dangerous innovation. But I think it will
      be splendid to have a lady teacher, and I really don’t see how I’m
      going to live through the two weeks before school begins. I’m so
      impatient to see her.”

      CHAPTER XXIII.<br>
      Anne Comes to Grief in an Affair of Honor</h2>
    
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>NNE had to live through
      more than two weeks, as it happened. Almost a month having elapsed since the
      liniment cake episode, it was high time for her to get into fresh trouble of
      some sort, little mistakes, such as absentmindedly emptying a pan of skim milk
      into a basket of yarn balls in the pantry instead of into the pigs’
      bucket, and walking clean over the edge of the log bridge into the brook while
      wrapped in imaginative reverie, not really being worth counting.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      A week after the tea at the manse Diana Barry gave a party.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Small and select,” Anne assured Marilla. “Just the girls in
      our class.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      They had a very good time and nothing untoward happened until after tea, when
      they found themselves in the Barry garden, a little tired of all their games
      and ripe for any enticing form of mischief which might present itself. This
      presently took the form of “daring.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Daring was the fashionable amusement among the Avonlea small fry just then. It
      had begun among the boys, but soon spread to the girls, and all the silly
      things that were done in Avonlea that summer because the doers thereof were
      “dared” to do them would fill a book by themselves.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      First of all Carrie Sloane dared Ruby Gillis to climb to a certain point in the
      huge old willow tree before the front door; which Ruby Gillis, albeit in mortal
      dread of the fat green caterpillars with which said tree was infested and with
      the fear of her mother before her eyes if she should tear her new muslin dress,
      nimbly did, to the discomfiture of the aforesaid Carrie Sloane. Then Josie Pye
      dared Jane Andrews to hop on her left leg around the garden without stopping
      once or putting her right foot to the ground; which Jane Andrews gamely tried
      to do, but gave out at the third corner and had to confess herself defeated.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Josie’s triumph being rather more pronounced than good taste permitted,
      Anne Shirley dared her to walk along the top of the board fence which bounded
      the garden to the east. Now, to “walk” board fences requires more
      skill and steadiness of head and heel than one might suppose who has never
      tried it. But Josie Pye, if deficient in some qualities that make for
      popularity, had at least a natural and inborn gift, duly cultivated, for
      walking board fences. Josie walked the Barry fence with an airy unconcern which
      seemed to imply that a little thing like that wasn’t worth a
      “dare.” Reluctant admiration greeted her exploit, for most of the
      other girls could appreciate it, having suffered many things themselves in
      their efforts to walk fences. Josie descended from her perch, flushed with
      victory, and darted a defiant glance at Anne.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Anne tossed her red braids.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I don’t think it’s such a very wonderful thing to walk a
      little, low, board fence,” she said. “I knew a girl in Marysville
      who could walk the ridgepole of a roof.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I don’t believe it,” said Josie flatly. “I don’t
      believe anybody could walk a ridgepole. <i>You</i> couldn’t,
      anyhow.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Couldn’t I?” cried Anne rashly.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Then I dare you to do it,” said Josie defiantly. “I dare you
      to climb up there and walk the ridgepole of Mr. Barry’s kitchen
      roof.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Anne turned pale, but there was clearly only one thing to be done. She walked
      toward the house, where a ladder was leaning against the kitchen roof. All the
      fifth-class girls said, “Oh!” partly in excitement, partly in
      dismay.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Don’t you do it, Anne,” entreated Diana. “You’ll
      fall off and be killed. Never mind Josie Pye. It isn’t fair to dare
      anybody to do anything so dangerous.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I must do it. My honor is at stake,” said Anne solemnly. “I
      shall walk that ridgepole, Diana, or perish in the attempt. If I am killed you
      are to have my pearl bead ring.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Anne climbed the ladder amid breathless silence, gained the ridgepole, balanced
      herself uprightly on that precarious footing, and started to walk along it,
      dizzily conscious that she was uncomfortably high up in the world and that
      walking ridgepoles was not a thing in which your imagination helped you out
      much. Nevertheless, she managed to take several steps before the catastrophe
      came. Then she swayed, lost her balance, stumbled, staggered, and fell, sliding
      down over the sun-baked roof and crashing off it through the tangle of Virginia
      creeper beneath—all before the dismayed circle below could give a
      simultaneous, terrified shriek.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      If Anne had tumbled off the roof on the side up which she had ascended Diana
      would probably have fallen heir to the pearl bead ring then and there.
      Fortunately she fell on the other side, where the roof extended down over the
      porch so nearly to the ground that a fall therefrom was a much less serious
      thing. Nevertheless, when Diana and the other girls had rushed frantically
      around the house—except Ruby Gillis, who remained as if rooted to the
      ground and went into hysterics—they found Anne lying all white and limp
      among the wreck and ruin of the Virginia creeper.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Anne, are you killed?” shrieked Diana, throwing herself on her
      knees beside her friend. “Oh, Anne, dear Anne, speak just one word to me
      and tell me if you’re killed.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      To the immense relief of all the girls, and especially of Josie Pye, who, in
      spite of lack of imagination, had been seized with horrible visions of a future
      branded as the girl who was the cause of Anne Shirley’s early and tragic
      death, Anne sat dizzily up and answered uncertainly:
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “No, Diana, I am not killed, but I think I am rendered
      unconscious.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Where?” sobbed Carrie Sloane. “Oh, where, Anne?”
      Before Anne could answer Mrs. Barry appeared on the scene. At sight of her Anne
      tried to scramble to her feet, but sank back again with a sharp little cry of
      pain.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “What’s the matter? Where have you hurt yourself?” demanded
      Mrs. Barry.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “My ankle,” gasped Anne. “Oh, Diana, please find your father
      and ask him to take me home. I know I can never walk there. And I’m sure
      I couldn’t hop so far on one foot when Jane couldn’t even hop
      around the garden.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Marilla was out in the orchard picking a panful of summer apples when she saw
      Mr. Barry coming over the log bridge and up the slope, with Mrs. Barry beside
      him and a whole procession of little girls trailing after him. In his arms he
      carried Anne, whose head lay limply against his shoulder.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      At that moment Marilla had a revelation. In the sudden stab of fear that
      pierced her very heart she realized what Anne had come to mean to her. She
      would have admitted that she liked Anne—nay, that she was very fond of
      Anne. But now she knew as she hurried wildly down the slope that Anne was
      dearer to her than anything else on earth.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Mr. Barry, what has happened to her?” she gasped, more white and
      shaken than the self-contained, sensible Marilla had been for many years.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Anne herself answered, lifting her head.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Don’t be very frightened, Marilla. I was walking the ridgepole and
      I fell off. I expect I have sprained my ankle. But, Marilla, I might have
      broken my neck. Let us look on the bright side of things.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I might have known you’d go and do something of the sort when I
      let you go to that party,” said Marilla, sharp and shrewish in her very
      relief. “Bring her in here, Mr. Barry, and lay her on the sofa. Mercy me,
      the child has gone and fainted!”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      It was quite true. Overcome by the pain of her injury, Anne had one more of her
      wishes granted to her. She had fainted dead away.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Matthew, hastily summoned from the harvest field, was straightway dispatched
      for the doctor, who in due time came, to discover that the injury was more
      serious than they had supposed. Anne’s ankle was broken.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      That night, when Marilla went up to the east gable, where a white-faced girl
      was lying, a plaintive voice greeted her from the bed.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Aren’t you very sorry for me, Marilla?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “It was your own fault,” said Marilla, twitching down the blind and
      lighting a lamp.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “And that is just why you should be sorry for me,” said Anne,
      “because the thought that it is all my own fault is what makes it so
      hard. If I could blame it on anybody I would feel so much better. But what
      would you have done, Marilla, if you had been dared to walk a ridgepole?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I’d have stayed on good firm ground and let them dare away. Such
      absurdity!” said Marilla.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Anne sighed.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “But you have such strength of mind, Marilla. I haven’t. I just
      felt that I couldn’t bear Josie Pye’s scorn. She would have crowed
      over me all my life. And I think I have been punished so much that you
      needn’t be very cross with me, Marilla. It’s not a bit nice to
      faint, after all. And the doctor hurt me dreadfully when he was setting my
      ankle. I won’t be able to go around for six or seven weeks and I’ll
      miss the new lady teacher. She won’t be new any more by the time
      I’m able to go to school. And Gil—everybody will get ahead of me in
      class. Oh, I am an afflicted mortal. But I’ll try to bear it all bravely
      if only you won’t be cross with me, Marilla.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “There, there, I’m not cross,” said Marilla.
      “You’re an unlucky child, there’s no doubt about that; but as
      you say, you’ll have the suffering of it. Here now, try and eat some
      supper.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Isn’t it fortunate I’ve got such an imagination?” said
      Anne. “It will help me through splendidly, I expect. What do people who
      haven’t any imagination do when they break their bones, do you suppose,
      Marilla?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Anne had good reason to bless her imagination many a time and oft during the
      tedious seven weeks that followed. But she was not solely dependent on it. She
      had many visitors and not a day passed without one or more of the schoolgirls
      dropping in to bring her flowers and books and tell her all the happenings in
      the juvenile world of Avonlea.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Everybody has been so good and kind, Marilla,” sighed Anne
      happily, on the day when she could first limp across the floor. “It
      isn’t very pleasant to be laid up; but there is a bright side to it,
      Marilla. You find out how many friends you have. Why, even Superintendent Bell
      came to see me, and he’s really a very fine man. Not a kindred spirit, of
      course; but still I like him and I’m awfully sorry I ever criticized his
      prayers. I believe now he really does mean them, only he has got into the habit
      of saying them as if he didn’t. He could get over that if he’d take
      a little trouble. I gave him a good broad hint. I told him how hard I tried to
      make my own little private prayers interesting. He told me all about the time
      he broke his ankle when he was a boy. It does seem so strange to think of
      Superintendent Bell ever being a boy. Even my imagination has its limits, for I
      can’t imagine <i>that</i>. When I try to imagine him as a boy I see him
      with gray whiskers and spectacles, just as he looks in Sunday-school, only
      small. Now, it’s so easy to imagine Mrs. Allan as a little girl. Mrs.
      Allan has been to see me fourteen times. Isn’t that something to be proud
      of, Marilla? When a minister’s wife has so many claims on her time! She
      is such a cheerful person to have visit you, too. She never tells you
      it’s your own fault and she hopes you’ll be a better girl on
      account of it. Mrs. Lynde always told me that when she came to see me; and she
      said it in a kind of way that made me feel she might hope I’d be a better
      girl but didn’t really believe I would. Even Josie Pye came to see me. I
      received her as politely as I could, because I think she was sorry she dared me
      to walk a ridgepole. If I had been killed she would had to carry a dark burden
      of remorse all her life. Diana has been a faithful friend. She’s been
      over every day to cheer my lonely pillow. But oh, I shall be so glad when I can
      go to school for I’ve heard such exciting things about the new teacher.
      The girls all think she is perfectly sweet. Diana says she has the loveliest
      fair curly hair and such fascinating eyes. She dresses beautifully, and her
      sleeve puffs are bigger than anybody else’s in Avonlea. Every other
      Friday afternoon she has recitations and everybody has to say a piece or take
      part in a dialogue. Oh, it’s just glorious to think of it. Josie Pye says
      she hates it but that is just because Josie has so little imagination. Diana
      and Ruby Gillis and Jane Andrews are preparing a dialogue, called ‘A
      Morning Visit,’ for next Friday. And the Friday afternoons they
      don’t have recitations Miss Stacy takes them all to the woods for a
      ‘field’ day and they study ferns and flowers and birds. And they
      have physical culture exercises every morning and evening. Mrs. Lynde says she
      never heard of such goings on and it all comes of having a lady teacher. But I
      think it must be splendid and I believe I shall find that Miss Stacy is a
      kindred spirit.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “There’s one thing plain to be seen, Anne,” said Marilla,
      “and that is that your fall off the Barry roof hasn’t injured your
      tongue at all.”

      Miss Stacy and Her Pupils Get Up a Concert</h2>
    
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>T was October again
      when Anne was ready to go back to school—a glorious October, all red and
      gold, with mellow mornings when the valleys were filled with delicate mists as
      if the spirit of autumn had poured them in for the sun to drain—amethyst,
      pearl, silver, rose, and smoke-blue. The dews were so heavy that the fields
      glistened like cloth of silver and there were such heaps of rustling leaves in
      the hollows of many-stemmed woods to run crisply through. The Birch Path was a
      canopy of yellow and the ferns were sear and brown all along it. There was a
      tang in the very air that inspired the hearts of small maidens tripping, unlike
      snails, swiftly and willingly to school; and it <i>was</i> jolly to be back
      again at the little brown desk beside Diana, with Ruby Gillis nodding across
      the aisle and Carrie Sloane sending up notes and Julia Bell passing a
      “chew” of gum down from the back seat. Anne drew a long breath of
      happiness as she sharpened her pencil and arranged her picture cards in her
      desk. Life was certainly very interesting.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      In the new teacher she found another true and helpful friend. Miss Stacy was a
      bright, sympathetic young woman with the happy gift of winning and holding the
      affections of her pupils and bringing out the best that was in them mentally
      and morally. Anne expanded like a flower under this wholesome influence and
      carried home to the admiring Matthew and the critical Marilla glowing accounts
      of schoolwork and aims.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I love Miss Stacy with my whole heart, Marilla. She is so ladylike and
      she has such a sweet voice. When she pronounces my name I feel
      <i>instinctively</i> that she’s spelling it with an E. We had recitations
      this afternoon. I just wish you could have been there to hear me recite
      ‘Mary, Queen of Scots.’ I just put my whole soul into it. Ruby
      Gillis told me coming home that the way I said the line, ‘Now for my
      father’s arm,’ she said, ‘my woman’s heart
      farewell,’ just made her blood run cold.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Well now, you might recite it for me some of these days, out in the
      barn,” suggested Matthew.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Of course I will,” said Anne meditatively, “but I
      won’t be able to do it so well, I know. It won’t be so exciting as
      it is when you have a whole schoolful before you hanging breathlessly on your
      words. I know I won’t be able to make your blood run cold.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Mrs. Lynde says it made <i>her</i> blood run cold to see the boys
      climbing to the very tops of those big trees on Bell’s hill after
      crows’ nests last Friday,” said Marilla. “I wonder at Miss
      Stacy for encouraging it.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “But we wanted a crow’s nest for nature study,” explained
      Anne. “That was on our field afternoon. Field afternoons are splendid,
      Marilla. And Miss Stacy explains everything so beautifully. We have to write
      compositions on our field afternoons and I write the best ones.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “It’s very vain of you to say so then. You’d better let your
      teacher say it.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “But she <i>did</i> say it, Marilla. And indeed I’m not vain about
      it. How can I be, when I’m such a dunce at geometry? Although I’m
      really beginning to see through it a little, too. Miss Stacy makes it so clear.
      Still, I’ll never be good at it and I assure you it is a humbling
      reflection. But I love writing compositions. Mostly Miss Stacy lets us choose
      our own subjects; but next week we are to write a composition on some
      remarkable person. It’s hard to choose among so many remarkable people
      who have lived. Mustn’t it be splendid to be remarkable and have
      compositions written about you after you’re dead? Oh, I would dearly love
      to be remarkable. I think when I grow up I’ll be a trained nurse and go
      with the Red Crosses to the field of battle as a messenger of mercy. That is,
      if I don’t go out as a foreign missionary. That would be very romantic,
      but one would have to be very good to be a missionary, and that would be a
      stumbling block. We have physical culture exercises every day, too. They make
      you graceful and promote digestion.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Promote fiddlesticks!” said Marilla, who honestly thought it was
      all nonsense.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      But all the field afternoons and recitation Fridays and physical culture
      contortions paled before a project which Miss Stacy brought forward in
      November. This was that the scholars of Avonlea school should get up a concert
      and hold it in the hall on Christmas Night, for the laudable purpose of helping
      to pay for a schoolhouse flag. The pupils one and all taking graciously to this
      plan, the preparations for a program were begun at once. And of all the excited
      performers-elect none was so excited as Anne Shirley, who threw herself into
      the undertaking heart and soul, hampered as she was by Marilla’s
      disapproval. Marilla thought it all rank foolishness.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “It’s just filling your heads up with nonsense and taking time that
      ought to be put on your lessons,” she grumbled. “I don’t
      approve of children’s getting up concerts and racing about to practices.
      It makes them vain and forward and fond of gadding.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “But think of the worthy object,” pleaded Anne. “A flag will
      cultivate a spirit of patriotism, Marilla.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Fudge! There’s precious little patriotism in the thoughts of any
      of you. All you want is a good time.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Well, when you can combine patriotism and fun, isn’t it all right?
      Of course it’s real nice to be getting up a concert. We’re going to
      have six choruses and Diana is to sing a solo. I’m in two
      dialogues—‘The Society for the Suppression of Gossip’ and
      ‘The Fairy Queen.’ The boys are going to have a dialogue too. And
      I’m to have two recitations, Marilla. I just tremble when I think of it,
      but it’s a nice thrilly kind of tremble. And we’re to have a
      tableau at the last—‘Faith, Hope and Charity.’ Diana and Ruby
      and I are to be in it, all draped in white with flowing hair. I’m to be
      Hope, with my hands clasped—so—and my eyes uplifted. I’m
      going to practice my recitations in the garret. Don’t be alarmed if you
      hear me groaning. I have to groan heartrendingly in one of them, and it’s
      really hard to get up a good artistic groan, Marilla. Josie Pye is sulky
      because she didn’t get the part she wanted in the dialogue. She wanted to
      be the fairy queen. That would have been ridiculous, for who ever heard of a
      fairy queen as fat as Josie? Fairy queens must be slender. Jane Andrews is to
      be the queen and I am to be one of her maids of honor. Josie says she thinks a
      red-haired fairy is just as ridiculous as a fat one, but I do not let myself
      mind what Josie says. I’m to have a wreath of white roses on my hair and
      Ruby Gillis is going to lend me her slippers because I haven’t any of my
      own. It’s necessary for fairies to have slippers, you know. You
      couldn’t imagine a fairy wearing boots, could you? Especially with copper
      toes? We are going to decorate the hall with creeping spruce and fir mottoes
      with pink tissue-paper roses in them. And we are all to march in two by two
      after the audience is seated, while Emma White plays a march on the organ. Oh,
      Marilla, I know you are not so enthusiastic about it as I am, but don’t
      you hope your little Anne will distinguish herself?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “All I hope is that you’ll behave yourself. I’ll be heartily
      glad when all this fuss is over and you’ll be able to settle down. You
      are simply good for nothing just now with your head stuffed full of dialogues
      and groans and tableaus. As for your tongue, it’s a marvel it’s not
      clean worn out.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Anne sighed and betook herself to the back yard, over which a young new moon
      was shining through the leafless poplar boughs from an apple-green western sky,
      and where Matthew was splitting wood. Anne perched herself on a block and
      talked the concert over with him, sure of an appreciative and sympathetic
      listener in this instance at least.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Well now, I reckon it’s going to be a pretty good concert. And I
      expect you’ll do your part fine,” he said, smiling down into her
      eager, vivacious little face. Anne smiled back at him. Those two were the best
      of friends and Matthew thanked his stars many a time and oft that he had
      nothing to do with bringing her up. That was Marilla’s exclusive duty; if
      it had been his he would have been worried over frequent conflicts between
      inclination and said duty. As it was, he was free to, “spoil
      Anne”—Marilla’s phrasing—as much as he liked. But it
      was not such a bad arrangement after all; a little “appreciation”
      sometimes does quite as much good as all the conscientious “bringing
      up” in the world.

      CHAPTER XXV.<br>
      Matthew Insists on Puffed Sleeves</h2>
    
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>ATTHEW was having a bad
      ten minutes of it. He had come into the kitchen, in the twilight of a cold,
      gray December evening, and had sat down in the woodbox corner to take off his
      heavy boots, unconscious of the fact that Anne and a bevy of her schoolmates
      were having a practice of “The Fairy Queen” in the sitting room.
      Presently they came trooping through the hall and out into the kitchen,
      laughing and chattering gaily. They did not see Matthew, who shrank bashfully
      back into the shadows beyond the woodbox with a boot in one hand and a bootjack
      in the other, and he watched them shyly for the aforesaid ten minutes as they
      put on caps and jackets and talked about the dialogue and the concert. Anne
      stood among them, bright eyed and animated as they; but Matthew suddenly became
      conscious that there was something about her different from her mates. And what
      worried Matthew was that the difference impressed him as being something that
      should not exist. Anne had a brighter face, and bigger, starrier eyes, and more
      delicate features than the other; even shy, unobservant Matthew had learned to
      take note of these things; but the difference that disturbed him did not
      consist in any of these respects. Then in what did it consist?
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Matthew was haunted by this question long after the girls had gone, arm in arm,
      down the long, hard-frozen lane and Anne had betaken herself to her books. He
      could not refer it to Marilla, who, he felt, would be quite sure to sniff
      scornfully and remark that the only difference she saw between Anne and the
      other girls was that they sometimes kept their tongues quiet while Anne never
      did. This, Matthew felt, would be no great help.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      He had recourse to his pipe that evening to help him study it out, much to
      Marilla’s disgust. After two hours of smoking and hard reflection Matthew
      arrived at a solution of his problem. Anne was not dressed like the other
      girls!
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The more Matthew thought about the matter the more he was convinced that Anne
      never had been dressed like the other girls—never since she had come to
      Green Gables. Marilla kept her clothed in plain, dark dresses, all made after
      the same unvarying pattern. If Matthew knew there was such a thing as fashion
      in dress it was as much as he did; but he was quite sure that Anne’s
      sleeves did not look at all like the sleeves the other girls wore. He recalled
      the cluster of little girls he had seen around her that evening—all gay
      in waists of red and blue and pink and white—and he wondered why Marilla
      always kept her so plainly and soberly gowned.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Of course, it must be all right. Marilla knew best and Marilla was bringing her
      up. Probably some wise, inscrutable motive was to be served thereby. But surely
      it would do no harm to let the child have one pretty dress—something like
      Diana Barry always wore. Matthew decided that he would give her one; that
      surely could not be objected to as an unwarranted putting in of his oar.
      Christmas was only a fortnight off. A nice new dress would be the very thing
      for a present. Matthew, with a sigh of satisfaction, put away his pipe and went
      to bed, while Marilla opened all the doors and aired the house.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The very next evening Matthew betook himself to Carmody to buy the dress,
      determined to get the worst over and have done with it. It would be, he felt
      assured, no trifling ordeal. There were some things Matthew could buy and prove
      himself no mean bargainer; but he knew he would be at the mercy of shopkeepers
      when it came to buying a girl’s dress.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      After much cogitation Matthew resolved to go to Samuel Lawson’s store
      instead of William Blair’s. To be sure, the Cuthberts always had gone to
      William Blair’s; it was almost as much a matter of conscience with them
      as to attend the Presbyterian church and vote Conservative. But William
      Blair’s two daughters frequently waited on customers there and Matthew
      held them in absolute dread. He could contrive to deal with them when he knew
      exactly what he wanted and could point it out; but in such a matter as this,
      requiring explanation and consultation, Matthew felt that he must be sure of a
      man behind the counter. So he would go to Lawson’s, where Samuel or his
      son would wait on him.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Alas! Matthew did not know that Samuel, in the recent expansion of his
      business, had set up a lady clerk also; she was a niece of his wife’s and
      a very dashing young person indeed, with a huge, drooping pompadour, big,
      rolling brown eyes, and a most extensive and bewildering smile. She was dressed
      with exceeding smartness and wore several bangle bracelets that glittered and
      rattled and tinkled with every movement of her hands. Matthew was covered with
      confusion at finding her there at all; and those bangles completely wrecked his
      wits at one fell swoop.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “What can I do for you this evening, Mr. Cuthbert?” Miss Lucilla
      Harris inquired, briskly and ingratiatingly, tapping the counter with both
      hands.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Have you any—any—any—well now, say any garden
      rakes?” stammered Matthew.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Miss Harris looked somewhat surprised, as well she might, to hear a man
      inquiring for garden rakes in the middle of December.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I believe we have one or two left over,” she said, “but
      they’re upstairs in the lumber room. I’ll go and see.” During
      her absence Matthew collected his scattered senses for another effort.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      When Miss Harris returned with the rake and cheerfully inquired:
      “Anything else tonight, Mr. Cuthbert?” Matthew took his courage in
      both hands and replied: “Well now, since you suggest it, I might as
      well—take—that is—look at—buy some—some
      hayseed.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Miss Harris had heard Matthew Cuthbert called odd. She now concluded that he
      was entirely crazy.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “We only keep hayseed in the spring,” she explained loftily.
      “We’ve none on hand just now.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Oh, certainly—certainly—just as you say,” stammered
      unhappy Matthew, seizing the rake and making for the door. At the threshold he
      recollected that he had not paid for it and he turned miserably back. While
      Miss Harris was counting out his change he rallied his powers for a final
      desperate attempt.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Well now—if it isn’t too much trouble—I might as
      well—that is—I’d like to look at—at—some
      sugar.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “White or brown?” queried Miss Harris patiently.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Oh—well now—brown,” said Matthew feebly.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “There’s a barrel of it over there,” said Miss Harris,
      shaking her bangles at it. “It’s the only kind we have.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I’ll—I’ll take twenty pounds of it,” said
      Matthew, with beads of perspiration standing on his forehead.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Matthew had driven halfway home before he was his own man again. It had been a
      gruesome experience, but it served him right, he thought, for committing the
      heresy of going to a strange store. When he reached home he hid the rake in the
      tool house, but the sugar he carried in to Marilla.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Brown sugar!” exclaimed Marilla. “Whatever possessed you to
      get so much? You know I never use it except for the hired man’s porridge
      or black fruit cake. Jerry’s gone and I’ve made my cake long ago.
      It’s not good sugar, either—it’s coarse and
      dark—William Blair doesn’t usually keep sugar like that.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I—I thought it might come in handy sometime,” said Matthew,
      making good his escape.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      When Matthew came to think the matter over he decided that a woman was required
      to cope with the situation. Marilla was out of the question. Matthew felt sure
      she would throw cold water on his project at once. Remained only Mrs. Lynde;
      for of no other woman in Avonlea would Matthew have dared to ask advice. To
      Mrs. Lynde he went accordingly, and that good lady promptly took the matter out
      of the harassed man’s hands.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Pick out a dress for you to give Anne? To be sure I will. I’m
      going to Carmody tomorrow and I’ll attend to it. Have you something
      particular in mind? No? Well, I’ll just go by my own judgment then. I
      believe a nice rich brown would just suit Anne, and William Blair has some new
      gloria in that’s real pretty. Perhaps you’d like me to make it up
      for her, too, seeing that if Marilla was to make it Anne would probably get
      wind of it before the time and spoil the surprise? Well, I’ll do it. No,
      it isn’t a mite of trouble. I like sewing. I’ll make it to fit my
      niece, Jenny Gillis, for she and Anne are as like as two peas as far as figure
      goes.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Well now, I’m much obliged,” said Matthew,
      “and—and—I dunno—but I’d like—I think they
      make the sleeves different nowadays to what they used to be. If it
      wouldn’t be asking too much I—I’d like them made in the new
      way.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Puffs? Of course. You needn’t worry a speck more about it,
      Matthew. I’ll make it up in the very latest fashion,” said Mrs.
      Lynde. To herself she added when Matthew had gone:
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “It’ll be a real satisfaction to see that poor child wearing
      something decent for once. The way Marilla dresses her is positively
      ridiculous, that’s what, and I’ve ached to tell her so plainly a
      dozen times. I’ve held my tongue though, for I can see Marilla
      doesn’t want advice and she thinks she knows more about bringing children
      up than I do for all she’s an old maid. But that’s always the way.
      Folks that has brought up children know that there’s no hard and fast
      method in the world that’ll suit every child. But them as never have
      think it’s all as plain and easy as Rule of Three—just set your
      three terms down so fashion, and the sum ‘ll work out correct. But flesh
      and blood don’t come under the head of arithmetic and that’s where
      Marilla Cuthbert makes her mistake. I suppose she’s trying to cultivate a
      spirit of humility in Anne by dressing her as she does; but it’s more
      likely to cultivate envy and discontent. I’m sure the child must feel the
      difference between her clothes and the other girls’. But to think of
      Matthew taking notice of it! That man is waking up after being asleep for over
      sixty years.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Marilla knew all the following fortnight that Matthew had something on his
      mind, but what it was she could not guess, until Christmas Eve, when Mrs. Lynde
      brought up the new dress. Marilla behaved pretty well on the whole, although it
      is very likely she distrusted Mrs. Lynde’s diplomatic explanation that
      she had made the dress because Matthew was afraid Anne would find out about it
      too soon if Marilla made it.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “So this is what Matthew has been looking so mysterious over and grinning
      about to himself for two weeks, is it?” she said a little stiffly but
      tolerantly. “I knew he was up to some foolishness. Well, I must say I
      don’t think Anne needed any more dresses. I made her three good, warm,
      serviceable ones this fall, and anything more is sheer extravagance.
      There’s enough material in those sleeves alone to make a waist, I declare
      there is. You’ll just pamper Anne’s vanity, Matthew, and
      she’s as vain as a peacock now. Well, I hope she’ll be satisfied at
      last, for I know she’s been hankering after those silly sleeves ever
      since they came in, although she never said a word after the first. The puffs
      have been getting bigger and more ridiculous right along; they’re as big
      as balloons now. Next year anybody who wears them will have to go through a
      door sideways.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Christmas morning broke on a beautiful white world. It had been a very mild
      December and people had looked forward to a green Christmas; but just enough
      snow fell softly in the night to transfigure Avonlea. Anne peeped out from her
      frosted gable window with delighted eyes. The firs in the Haunted Wood were all
      feathery and wonderful; the birches and wild cherry-trees were outlined in
      pearl; the plowed fields were stretches of snowy dimples; and there was a crisp
      tang in the air that was glorious. Anne ran downstairs singing until her voice
      reechoed through Green Gables.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Merry Christmas, Marilla! Merry Christmas, Matthew! Isn’t it a
      lovely Christmas? I’m so glad it’s white. Any other kind of
      Christmas doesn’t seem real, does it? I don’t like green
      Christmases. They’re not green—they’re just nasty faded
      browns and grays. What makes people call them green?
      Why—why—Matthew, is that for me? Oh, Matthew!”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Matthew had sheepishly unfolded the dress from its paper swathings and held it
      out with a deprecatory glance at Marilla, who feigned to be contemptuously
      filling the teapot, but nevertheless watched the scene out of the corner of her
      eye with a rather interested air.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Anne took the dress and looked at it in reverent silence. Oh, how pretty it
      was—a lovely soft brown gloria with all the gloss of silk; a skirt with
      dainty frills and shirrings; a waist elaborately pintucked in the most
      fashionable way, with a little ruffle of filmy lace at the neck. But the
      sleeves—they were the crowning glory! Long elbow cuffs, and above them
      two beautiful puffs divided by rows of shirring and bows of brown-silk ribbon.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “That’s a Christmas present for you, Anne,” said Matthew
      shyly. “Why—why—Anne, don’t you like it? Well
      now—well now.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      For Anne’s eyes had suddenly filled with tears.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Like it! Oh, Matthew!” Anne laid the dress over a chair and
      clasped her hands. “Matthew, it’s perfectly exquisite. Oh, I can
      never thank you enough. Look at those sleeves! Oh, it seems to me this must be
      a happy dream.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Well, well, let us have breakfast,” interrupted Marilla. “I
      must say, Anne, I don’t think you needed the dress; but since Matthew has
      got it for you, see that you take good care of it. There’s a hair ribbon
      Mrs. Lynde left for you. It’s brown, to match the dress. Come now, sit
      in.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I don’t see how I’m going to eat breakfast,” said Anne
      rapturously. “Breakfast seems so commonplace at such an exciting moment.
      I’d rather feast my eyes on that dress. I’m so glad that puffed
      sleeves are still fashionable. It did seem to me that I’d never get over
      it if they went out before I had a dress with them. I’d never have felt
      quite satisfied, you see. It was lovely of Mrs. Lynde to give me the ribbon
      too. I feel that I ought to be a very good girl indeed. It’s at times
      like this I’m sorry I’m not a model little girl; and I always
      resolve that I will be in future. But somehow it’s hard to carry out your
      resolutions when irresistible temptations come. Still, I really will make an
      extra effort after this.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      When the commonplace breakfast was over Diana appeared, crossing the white log
      bridge in the hollow, a gay little figure in her crimson ulster. Anne flew down
      the slope to meet her.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Merry Christmas, Diana! And oh, it’s a wonderful Christmas.
      I’ve something splendid to show you. Matthew has given me the loveliest
      dress, with <i>such</i> sleeves. I couldn’t even imagine any
      nicer.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I’ve got something more for you,” said Diana breathlessly.
      “Here—this box. Aunt Josephine sent us out a big box with ever so
      many things in it—and this is for you. I’d have brought it over
      last night, but it didn’t come until after dark, and I never feel very
      comfortable coming through the Haunted Wood in the dark now.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Anne opened the box and peeped in. First a card with “For the Anne-girl
      and Merry Christmas,” written on it; and then, a pair of the daintiest
      little kid slippers, with beaded toes and satin bows and glistening buckles.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Oh,” said Anne, “Diana, this is too much. I must be
      dreaming.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I call it providential,” said Diana. “You won’t have
      to borrow Ruby’s slippers now, and that’s a blessing, for
      they’re two sizes too big for you, and it would be awful to hear a fairy
      shuffling. Josie Pye would be delighted. Mind you, Rob Wright went home with
      Gertie Pye from the practice night before last. Did you ever hear anything
      equal to that?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      All the Avonlea scholars were in a fever of excitement that day, for the hall
      had to be decorated and a last grand rehearsal held.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The concert came off in the evening and was a pronounced success. The little
      hall was crowded; all the performers did excellently well, but Anne was the
      bright particular star of the occasion, as even envy, in the shape of Josie
      Pye, dared not deny.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Oh, hasn’t it been a brilliant evening?” sighed Anne, when
      it was all over and she and Diana were walking home together under a dark,
      starry sky.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Everything went off very well,” said Diana practically. “I
      guess we must have made as much as ten dollars. Mind you, Mr. Allan is going to
      send an account of it to the Charlottetown papers.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Oh, Diana, will we really see our names in print? It makes me thrill to
      think of it. Your solo was perfectly elegant, Diana. I felt prouder than you
      did when it was encored. I just said to myself, ‘It is my dear bosom
      friend who is so honored.’”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Well, your recitations just brought down the house, Anne. That sad one
      was simply splendid.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Oh, I was so nervous, Diana. When Mr. Allan called out my name I really
      cannot tell how I ever got up on that platform. I felt as if a million eyes
      were looking at me and through me, and for one dreadful moment I was sure I
      couldn’t begin at all. Then I thought of my lovely puffed sleeves and
      took courage. I knew that I must live up to those sleeves, Diana. So I started
      in, and my voice seemed to be coming from ever so far away. I just felt like a
      parrot. It’s providential that I practiced those recitations so often up
      in the garret, or I’d never have been able to get through. Did I groan
      all right?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Yes, indeed, you groaned lovely,” assured Diana.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I saw old Mrs. Sloane wiping away tears when I sat down. It was splendid
      to think I had touched somebody’s heart. It’s so romantic to take
      part in a concert, isn’t it? Oh, it’s been a very memorable
      occasion indeed.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Wasn’t the boys’ dialogue fine?” said Diana.
      “Gilbert Blythe was just splendid. Anne, I do think it’s awful mean
      the way you treat Gil. Wait till I tell you. When you ran off the platform
      after the fairy dialogue one of your roses fell out of your hair. I saw Gil
      pick it up and put it in his breast pocket. There now. You’re so romantic
      that I’m sure you ought to be pleased at that.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “It’s nothing to me what that person does,” said Anne
      loftily. “I simply never waste a thought on him, Diana.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      That night Marilla and Matthew, who had been out to a concert for the first
      time in twenty years, sat for a while by the kitchen fire after Anne had gone
      to bed.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Well now, I guess our Anne did as well as any of them,” said
      Matthew proudly.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Yes, she did,” admitted Marilla. “She’s a bright
      child, Matthew. And she looked real nice too. I’ve been kind of opposed
      to this concert scheme, but I suppose there’s no real harm in it after
      all. Anyhow, I was proud of Anne tonight, although I’m not going to tell
      her so.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Well now, I was proud of her and I did tell her so ‘fore she went
      upstairs,” said Matthew. “We must see what we can do for her some
      of these days, Marilla. I guess she’ll need something more than Avonlea
      school by and by.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “There’s time enough to think of that,” said Marilla.
      “She’s only thirteen in March. Though tonight it struck me she was
      growing quite a big girl. Mrs. Lynde made that dress a mite too long, and it
      makes Anne look so tall. She’s quick to learn and I guess the best thing
      we can do for her will be to send her to Queen’s after a spell. But
      nothing need be said about that for a year or two yet.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Well now, it’ll do no harm to be thinking it over off and
      on,” said Matthew. “Things like that are all the better for lots of
      thinking over.”

      CHAPTER XXVI.<br>
      The Story Club Is Formed</h2>
    
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">J</span>UNIOR Avonlea found it
      hard to settle down to humdrum existence again. To Anne in particular things
      seemed fearfully flat, stale, and unprofitable after the goblet of excitement
      she had been sipping for weeks. Could she go back to the former quiet pleasures
      of those faraway days before the concert? At first, as she told Diana, she did
      not really think she could.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I’m positively certain, Diana, that life can never be quite the
      same again as it was in those olden days,” she said mournfully, as if
      referring to a period of at least fifty years back. “Perhaps after a
      while I’ll get used to it, but I’m afraid concerts spoil people for
      everyday life. I suppose that is why Marilla disapproves of them. Marilla is
      such a sensible woman. It must be a great deal better to be sensible; but
      still, I don’t believe I’d really want to be a sensible person,
      because they are so unromantic. Mrs. Lynde says there is no danger of my ever
      being one, but you can never tell. I feel just now that I may grow up to be
      sensible yet. But perhaps that is only because I’m tired. I simply
      couldn’t sleep last night for ever so long. I just lay awake and imagined
      the concert over and over again. That’s one splendid thing about such
      affairs—it’s so lovely to look back to them.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Eventually, however, Avonlea school slipped back into its old groove and took
      up its old interests. To be sure, the concert left traces. Ruby Gillis and Emma
      White, who had quarreled over a point of precedence in their platform seats, no
      longer sat at the same desk, and a promising friendship of three years was
      broken up. Josie Pye and Julia Bell did not “speak” for three
      months, because Josie Pye had told Bessie Wright that Julia Bell’s bow
      when she got up to recite made her think of a chicken jerking its head, and
      Bessie told Julia. None of the Sloanes would have any dealings with the Bells,
      because the Bells had declared that the Sloanes had too much to do in the
      program, and the Sloanes had retorted that the Bells were not capable of doing
      the little they had to do properly. Finally, Charlie Sloane fought Moody
      Spurgeon MacPherson, because Moody Spurgeon had said that Anne Shirley put on
      airs about her recitations, and Moody Spurgeon was “licked”;
      consequently Moody Spurgeon’s sister, Ella May, would not
      “speak” to Anne Shirley all the rest of the winter. With the
      exception of these trifling frictions, work in Miss Stacy’s little
      kingdom went on with regularity and smoothness.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The winter weeks slipped by. It was an unusually mild winter, with so little
      snow that Anne and Diana could go to school nearly every day by way of the
      Birch Path. On Anne’s birthday they were tripping lightly down it,
      keeping eyes and ears alert amid all their chatter, for Miss Stacy had told
      them that they must soon write a composition on “A Winter’s Walk in
      the Woods,” and it behooved them to be observant.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Just think, Diana, I’m thirteen years old today,” remarked
      Anne in an awed voice. “I can scarcely realize that I’m in my
      teens. When I woke this morning it seemed to me that everything must be
      different. You’ve been thirteen for a month, so I suppose it
      doesn’t seem such a novelty to you as it does to me. It makes life seem
      so much more interesting. In two more years I’ll be really grown up.
      It’s a great comfort to think that I’ll be able to use big words
      then without being laughed at.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Ruby Gillis says she means to have a beau as soon as she’s
      fifteen,” said Diana.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Ruby Gillis thinks of nothing but beaus,” said Anne disdainfully.
      “She’s actually delighted when anyone writes her name up in a
      take-notice for all she pretends to be so mad. But I’m afraid that is an
      uncharitable speech. Mrs. Allan says we should never make uncharitable
      speeches; but they do slip out so often before you think, don’t they? I
      simply can’t talk about Josie Pye without making an uncharitable speech,
      so I never mention her at all. You may have noticed that. I’m trying to
      be as much like Mrs. Allan as I possibly can, for I think she’s perfect.
      Mr. Allan thinks so too. Mrs. Lynde says he just worships the ground she treads
      on and she doesn’t really think it right for a minister to set his
      affections so much on a mortal being. But then, Diana, even ministers are human
      and have their besetting sins just like everybody else. I had such an
      interesting talk with Mrs. Allan about besetting sins last Sunday afternoon.
      There are just a few things it’s proper to talk about on Sundays and that
      is one of them. My besetting sin is imagining too much and forgetting my
      duties. I’m striving very hard to overcome it and now that I’m
      really thirteen perhaps I’ll get on better.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “In four more years we’ll be able to put our hair up,” said
      Diana. “Alice Bell is only sixteen and she is wearing hers up, but I
      think that’s ridiculous. I shall wait until I’m seventeen.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “If I had Alice Bell’s crooked nose,” said Anne decidedly,
      “I wouldn’t—but there! I won’t say what I was going to
      because it was extremely uncharitable. Besides, I was comparing it with my own
      nose and that’s vanity. I’m afraid I think too much about my nose
      ever since I heard that compliment about it long ago. It really is a great
      comfort to me. Oh, Diana, look, there’s a rabbit. That’s something
      to remember for our woods composition. I really think the woods are just as
      lovely in winter as in summer. They’re so white and still, as if they
      were asleep and dreaming pretty dreams.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I won’t mind writing that composition when its time comes,”
      sighed Diana. “I can manage to write about the woods, but the one
      we’re to hand in Monday is terrible. The idea of Miss Stacy telling us to
      write a story out of our own heads!”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Why, it’s as easy as wink,” said Anne.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “It’s easy for you because you have an imagination,” retorted
      Diana, “but what would you do if you had been born without one? I suppose
      you have your composition all done?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Anne nodded, trying hard not to look virtuously complacent and failing
      miserably.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I wrote it last Monday evening. It’s called ‘The Jealous
      Rival; or In Death Not Divided.’ I read it to Marilla and she said it was
      stuff and nonsense. Then I read it to Matthew and he said it was fine. That is
      the kind of critic I like. It’s a sad, sweet story. I just cried like a
      child while I was writing it. It’s about two beautiful maidens called
      Cordelia Montmorency and Geraldine Seymour who lived in the same village and
      were devotedly attached to each other. Cordelia was a regal brunette with a
      coronet of midnight hair and duskly flashing eyes. Geraldine was a queenly
      blonde with hair like spun gold and velvety purple eyes.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I never saw anybody with purple eyes,” said Diana dubiously.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Neither did I. I just imagined them. I wanted something out of the
      common. Geraldine had an alabaster brow too. I’ve found out what an
      alabaster brow is. That is one of the advantages of being thirteen. You know so
      much more than you did when you were only twelve.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Well, what became of Cordelia and Geraldine?” asked Diana, who was
      beginning to feel rather interested in their fate.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “They grew in beauty side by side until they were sixteen. Then Bertram
      DeVere came to their native village and fell in love with the fair Geraldine.
      He saved her life when her horse ran away with her in a carriage, and she
      fainted in his arms and he carried her home three miles; because, you
      understand, the carriage was all smashed up. I found it rather hard to imagine
      the proposal because I had no experience to go by. I asked Ruby Gillis if she
      knew anything about how men proposed because I thought she’d likely be an
      authority on the subject, having so many sisters married. Ruby told me she was
      hid in the hall pantry when Malcolm Andres proposed to her sister Susan. She
      said Malcolm told Susan that his dad had given him the farm in his own name and
      then said, ‘What do you say, darling pet, if we get hitched this
      fall?’ And Susan said, ‘Yes—no—I don’t
      know—let me see’—and there they were, engaged as quick as
      that. But I didn’t think that sort of a proposal was a very romantic one,
      so in the end I had to imagine it out as well as I could. I made it very
      flowery and poetical and Bertram went on his knees, although Ruby Gillis says
      it isn’t done nowadays. Geraldine accepted him in a speech a page long. I
      can tell you I took a lot of trouble with that speech. I rewrote it five times
      and I look upon it as my masterpiece. Bertram gave her a diamond ring and a
      ruby necklace and told her they would go to Europe for a wedding tour, for he
      was immensely wealthy. But then, alas, shadows began to darken over their path.
      Cordelia was secretly in love with Bertram herself and when Geraldine told her
      about the engagement she was simply furious, especially when she saw the
      necklace and the diamond ring. All her affection for Geraldine turned to bitter
      hate and she vowed that she should never marry Bertram. But she pretended to be
      Geraldine’s friend the same as ever. One evening they were standing on
      the bridge over a rushing turbulent stream and Cordelia, thinking they were
      alone, pushed Geraldine over the brink with a wild, mocking, ‘Ha, ha,
      ha.’ But Bertram saw it all and he at once plunged into the current,
      exclaiming, ‘I will save thee, my peerless Geraldine.’ But alas, he
      had forgotten he couldn’t swim, and they were both drowned, clasped in
      each other’s arms. Their bodies were washed ashore soon afterwards. They
      were buried in the one grave and their funeral was most imposing, Diana.
      It’s so much more romantic to end a story up with a funeral than a
      wedding. As for Cordelia, she went insane with remorse and was shut up in a
      lunatic asylum. I thought that was a poetical retribution for her crime.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “How perfectly lovely!” sighed Diana, who belonged to
      Matthew’s school of critics. “I don’t see how you can make up
      such thrilling things out of your own head, Anne. I wish my imagination was as
      good as yours.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “It would be if you’d only cultivate it,” said Anne
      cheeringly. “I’ve just thought of a plan, Diana. Let you and me
      have a story club all our own and write stories for practice. I’ll help
      you along until you can do them by yourself. You ought to cultivate your
      imagination, you know. Miss Stacy says so. Only we must take the right way. I
      told her about the Haunted Wood, but she said we went the wrong way about it in
      that.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      This was how the story club came into existence. It was limited to Diana and
      Anne at first, but soon it was extended to include Jane Andrews and Ruby Gillis
      and one or two others who felt that their imaginations needed cultivating. No
      boys were allowed in it—although Ruby Gillis opined that their admission
      would make it more exciting—and each member had to produce one story a
      week.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “It’s extremely interesting,” Anne told Marilla. “Each
      girl has to read her story out loud and then we talk it over. We are going to
      keep them all sacredly and have them to read to our descendants. We each write
      under a nom-de-plume. Mine is Rosamond Montmorency. All the girls do pretty
      well. Ruby Gillis is rather sentimental. She puts too much lovemaking into her
      stories and you know too much is worse than too little. Jane never puts any
      because she says it makes her feel so silly when she had to read it out loud.
      Jane’s stories are extremely sensible. Then Diana puts too many murders
      into hers. She says most of the time she doesn’t know what to do with the
      people so she kills them off to get rid of them. I mostly always have to tell
      them what to write about, but that isn’t hard for I’ve millions of
      ideas.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I think this story-writing business is the foolishest yet,”
      scoffed Marilla. “You’ll get a pack of nonsense into your heads and
      waste time that should be put on your lessons. Reading stories is bad enough
      but writing them is worse.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “But we’re so careful to put a moral into them all, Marilla,”
      explained Anne. “I insist upon that. All the good people are rewarded and
      all the bad ones are suitably punished. I’m sure that must have a
      wholesome effect. The moral is the great thing. Mr. Allan says so. I read one
      of my stories to him and Mrs. Allan and they both agreed that the moral was
      excellent. Only they laughed in the wrong places. I like it better when people
      cry. Jane and Ruby almost always cry when I come to the pathetic parts. Diana
      wrote her Aunt Josephine about our club and her Aunt Josephine wrote back that
      we were to send her some of our stories. So we copied out four of our very best
      and sent them. Miss Josephine Barry wrote back that she had never read anything
      so amusing in her life. That kind of puzzled us because the stories were all
      very pathetic and almost everybody died. But I’m glad Miss Barry liked
      them. It shows our club is doing some good in the world. Mrs. Allan says that
      ought to be our object in everything. I do really try to make it my object but
      I forget so often when I’m having fun. I hope I shall be a little like
      Mrs. Allan when I grow up. Do you think there is any prospect of it,
      Marilla?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I shouldn’t say there was a great deal” was Marilla’s
      encouraging answer. “I’m sure Mrs. Allan was never such a silly,
      forgetful little girl as you are.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “No; but she wasn’t always so good as she is now either,”
      said Anne seriously. “She told me so herself—that is, she said she
      was a dreadful mischief when she was a girl and was always getting into
      scrapes. I felt so encouraged when I heard that. Is it very wicked of me,
      Marilla, to feel encouraged when I hear that other people have been bad and
      mischievous? Mrs. Lynde says it is. Mrs. Lynde says she always feels shocked
      when she hears of anyone ever having been naughty, no matter how small they
      were. Mrs. Lynde says she once heard a minister confess that when he was a boy
      he stole a strawberry tart out of his aunt’s pantry and she never had any
      respect for that minister again. Now, I wouldn’t have felt that way.
      I’d have thought that it was real noble of him to confess it, and
      I’d have thought what an encouraging thing it would be for small boys
      nowadays who do naughty things and are sorry for them to know that perhaps they
      may grow up to be ministers in spite of it. That’s how I’d feel,
      Marilla.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “The way I feel at present, Anne,” said Marilla, “is that
      it’s high time you had those dishes washed. You’ve taken half an
      hour longer than you should with all your chattering. Learn to work first and
      talk afterwards.”

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>ARILLA, walking home
      one late April evening from an Aid meeting, realized that the winter was over
      and gone with the thrill of delight that spring never fails to bring to the
      oldest and saddest as well as to the youngest and merriest. Marilla was not
      given to subjective analysis of her thoughts and feelings. She probably
      imagined that she was thinking about the Aids and their missionary box and the
      new carpet for the vestry room, but under these reflections was a harmonious
      consciousness of red fields smoking into pale-purply mists in the declining
      sun, of long, sharp-pointed fir shadows falling over the meadow beyond the
      brook, of still, crimson-budded maples around a mirrorlike wood pool, of a
      wakening in the world and a stir of hidden pulses under the gray sod. The
      spring was abroad in the land and Marilla’s sober, middle-aged step was
      lighter and swifter because of its deep, primal gladness.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Her eyes dwelt affectionately on Green Gables, peering through its network of
      trees and reflecting the sunlight back from its windows in several little
      coruscations of glory. Marilla, as she picked her steps along the damp lane,
      thought that it was really a satisfaction to know that she was going home to a
      briskly snapping wood fire and a table nicely spread for tea, instead of to the
      cold comfort of old Aid meeting evenings before Anne had come to Green Gables.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Consequently, when Marilla entered her kitchen and found the fire black out,
      with no sign of Anne anywhere, she felt justly disappointed and irritated. She
      had told Anne to be sure and have tea ready at five o’clock, but now she
      must hurry to take off her second-best dress and prepare the meal herself
      against Matthew’s return from plowing.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I’ll settle Miss Anne when she comes home,” said Marilla
      grimly, as she shaved up kindlings with a carving knife and with more vim than
      was strictly necessary. Matthew had come in and was waiting patiently for his
      tea in his corner. “She’s gadding off somewhere with Diana, writing
      stories or practicing dialogues or some such tomfoolery, and never thinking
      once about the time or her duties. She’s just got to be pulled up short
      and sudden on this sort of thing. I don’t care if Mrs. Allan does say
      she’s the brightest and sweetest child she ever knew. She may be bright
      and sweet enough, but her head is full of nonsense and there’s never any
      knowing what shape it’ll break out in next. Just as soon as she grows out
      of one freak she takes up with another. But there! Here I am saying the very
      thing I was so riled with Rachel Lynde for saying at the Aid today. I was real
      glad when Mrs. Allan spoke up for Anne, for if she hadn’t I know
      I’d have said something too sharp to Rachel before everybody.
      Anne’s got plenty of faults, goodness knows, and far be it from me to
      deny it. But I’m bringing her up and not Rachel Lynde, who’d pick
      faults in the Angel Gabriel himself if he lived in Avonlea. Just the same, Anne
      has no business to leave the house like this when I told her she was to stay
      home this afternoon and look after things. I must say, with all her faults, I
      never found her disobedient or untrustworthy before and I’m real sorry to
      find her so now.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Well now, I dunno,” said Matthew, who, being patient and wise and,
      above all, hungry, had deemed it best to let Marilla talk her wrath out
      unhindered, having learned by experience that she got through with whatever
      work was on hand much quicker if not delayed by untimely argument.
      “Perhaps you’re judging her too hasty, Marilla. Don’t call
      her untrustworthy until you’re sure she has disobeyed you. Mebbe it can
      all be explained—Anne’s a great hand at explaining.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “She’s not here when I told her to stay,” retorted Marilla.
      “I reckon she’ll find it hard to explain <i>that</i> to my
      satisfaction. Of course I knew you’d take her part, Matthew. But
      I’m bringing her up, not you.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      It was dark when supper was ready, and still no sign of Anne, coming hurriedly
      over the log bridge or up Lover’s Lane, breathless and repentant with a
      sense of neglected duties. Marilla washed and put away the dishes grimly. Then,
      wanting a candle to light her way down the cellar, she went up to the east
      gable for the one that generally stood on Anne’s table. Lighting it, she
      turned around to see Anne herself lying on the bed, face downward among the
      pillows.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Mercy on us,” said astonished Marilla, “have you been
      asleep, Anne?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “No,” was the muffled reply.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Are you sick then?” demanded Marilla anxiously, going over to the
      bed.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Anne cowered deeper into her pillows as if desirous of hiding herself forever
      from mortal eyes.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “No. But please, Marilla, go away and don’t look at me. I’m
      in the depths of despair and I don’t care who gets head in class or
      writes the best composition or sings in the Sunday-school choir any more.
      Little things like that are of no importance now because I don’t suppose
      I’ll ever be able to go anywhere again. My career is closed. Please,
      Marilla, go away and don’t look at me.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Did anyone ever hear the like?” the mystified Marilla wanted to
      know. “Anne Shirley, whatever is the matter with you? What have you done?
      Get right up this minute and tell me. This minute, I say. There now, what is
      it?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Anne had slid to the floor in despairing obedience.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Look at my hair, Marilla,” she whispered.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Accordingly, Marilla lifted her candle and looked scrutinizingly at
      Anne’s hair, flowing in heavy masses down her back. It certainly had a
      very strange appearance.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Anne Shirley, what have you done to your hair? Why, it’s
      <i>green!</i>”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Green it might be called, if it were any earthly color—a queer, dull,
      bronzy green, with streaks here and there of the original red to heighten the
      ghastly effect. Never in all her life had Marilla seen anything so grotesque as
      Anne’s hair at that moment.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Yes, it’s green,” moaned Anne. “I thought nothing
      could be as bad as red hair. But now I know it’s ten times worse to have
      green hair. Oh, Marilla, you little know how utterly wretched I am.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I little know how you got into this fix, but I mean to find out,”
      said Marilla. “Come right down to the kitchen—it’s too cold
      up here—and tell me just what you’ve done. I’ve been
      expecting something queer for some time. You haven’t got into any scrape
      for over two months, and I was sure another one was due. Now, then, what did
      you do to your hair?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I dyed it.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Dyed it! Dyed your hair! Anne Shirley, didn’t you know it was a
      wicked thing to do?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Yes, I knew it was a little wicked,” admitted Anne. “But I
      thought it was worth while to be a little wicked to get rid of red hair. I
      counted the cost, Marilla. Besides, I meant to be extra good in other ways to
      make up for it.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Well,” said Marilla sarcastically, “if I’d decided it
      was worth while to dye my hair I’d have dyed it a decent color at least.
      I wouldn’t have dyed it green.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “But I didn’t mean to dye it green, Marilla,” protested Anne
      dejectedly. “If I was wicked I meant to be wicked to some purpose. He
      said it would turn my hair a beautiful raven black—he positively assured
      me that it would. How could I doubt his word, Marilla? I know what it feels
      like to have your word doubted. And Mrs. Allan says we should never suspect
      anyone of not telling us the truth unless we have proof that they’re not.
      I have proof now—green hair is proof enough for anybody. But I
      hadn’t then and I believed every word he said <i>implicitly</i>.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Who said? Who are you talking about?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “The peddler that was here this afternoon. I bought the dye from
      him.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Anne Shirley, how often have I told you never to let one of those
      Italians in the house! I don’t believe in encouraging them to come around
      at all.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Oh, I didn’t let him in the house. I remembered what you told me,
      and I went out, carefully shut the door, and looked at his things on the step.
      Besides, he wasn’t an Italian—he was a German Jew. He had a big box
      full of very interesting things and he told me he was working hard to make
      enough money to bring his wife and children out from Germany. He spoke so
      feelingly about them that it touched my heart. I wanted to buy something from
      him to help him in such a worthy object. Then all at once I saw the bottle of
      hair dye. The peddler said it was warranted to dye any hair a beautiful raven
      black and wouldn’t wash off. In a trice I saw myself with beautiful
      raven-black hair and the temptation was irresistible. But the price of the
      bottle was seventy-five cents and I had only fifty cents left out of my chicken
      money. I think the peddler had a very kind heart, for he said that, seeing it
      was me, he’d sell it for fifty cents and that was just giving it away. So
      I bought it, and as soon as he had gone I came up here and applied it with an
      old hairbrush as the directions said. I used up the whole bottle, and oh,
      Marilla, when I saw the dreadful color it turned my hair I repented of being
      wicked, I can tell you. And I’ve been repenting ever since.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Well, I hope you’ll repent to good purpose,” said Marilla
      severely, “and that you’ve got your eyes opened to where your
      vanity has led you, Anne. Goodness knows what’s to be done. I suppose the
      first thing is to give your hair a good washing and see if that will do any
      good.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Accordingly, Anne washed her hair, scrubbing it vigorously with soap and water,
      but for all the difference it made she might as well have been scouring its
      original red. The peddler had certainly spoken the truth when he declared that
      the dye wouldn’t wash off, however his veracity might be impeached in
      other respects.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Oh, Marilla, what shall I do?” questioned Anne in tears. “I
      can never live this down. People have pretty well forgotten my other
      mistakes—the liniment cake and setting Diana drunk and flying into a
      temper with Mrs. Lynde. But they’ll never forget this. They will think I
      am not respectable. Oh, Marilla, ‘what a tangled web we weave when first
      we practice to deceive.’ That is poetry, but it is true. And oh, how
      Josie Pye will laugh! Marilla, I <i>cannot</i> face Josie Pye. I am the
      unhappiest girl in Prince Edward Island.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Anne’s unhappiness continued for a week. During that time she went
      nowhere and shampooed her hair every day. Diana alone of outsiders knew the
      fatal secret, but she promised solemnly never to tell, and it may be stated
      here and now that she kept her word. At the end of the week Marilla said
      decidedly:
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “It’s no use, Anne. That is fast dye if ever there was any. Your
      hair must be cut off; there is no other way. You can’t go out with it
      looking like that.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Anne’s lips quivered, but she realized the bitter truth of
      Marilla’s remarks. With a dismal sigh she went for the scissors.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Please cut it off at once, Marilla, and have it over. Oh, I feel that my
      heart is broken. This is such an unromantic affliction. The girls in books lose
      their hair in fevers or sell it to get money for some good deed, and I’m
      sure I wouldn’t mind losing my hair in some such fashion half so much.
      But there is nothing comforting in having your hair cut off because
      you’ve dyed it a dreadful color, is there? I’m going to weep all
      the time you’re cutting it off, if it won’t interfere. It seems
      such a tragic thing.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Anne wept then, but later on, when she went upstairs and looked in the glass,
      she was calm with despair. Marilla had done her work thoroughly and it had been
      necessary to shingle the hair as closely as possible. The result was not
      becoming, to state the case as mildly as may be. Anne promptly turned her glass
      to the wall.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I’ll never, never look at myself again until my hair grows,”
      she exclaimed passionately.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Then she suddenly righted the glass.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Yes, I will, too. I’d do penance for being wicked that way.
      I’ll look at myself every time I come to my room and see how ugly I am.
      And I won’t try to imagine it away, either. I never thought I was vain
      about my hair, of all things, but now I know I was, in spite of its being red,
      because it was so long and thick and curly. I expect something will happen to
      my nose next.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Anne’s clipped head made a sensation in school on the following Monday,
      but to her relief nobody guessed the real reason for it, not even Josie Pye,
      who, however, did not fail to inform Anne that she looked like a perfect
      scarecrow.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I didn’t say anything when Josie said that to me,” Anne
      confided that evening to Marilla, who was lying on the sofa after one of her
      headaches, “because I thought it was part of my punishment and I ought to
      bear it patiently. It’s hard to be told you look like a scarecrow and I
      wanted to say something back. But I didn’t. I just swept her one scornful
      look and then I forgave her. It makes you feel very virtuous when you forgive
      people, doesn’t it? I mean to devote all my energies to being good after
      this and I shall never try to be beautiful again. Of course it’s better
      to be good. I know it is, but it’s sometimes so hard to believe a thing
      even when you know it. I do really want to be good, Marilla, like you and Mrs.
      Allan and Miss Stacy, and grow up to be a credit to you. Diana says when my
      hair begins to grow to tie a black velvet ribbon around my head with a bow at
      one side. She says she thinks it will be very becoming. I will call it a
      snood—that sounds so romantic. But am I talking too much, Marilla? Does
      it hurt your head?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “My head is better now. It was terrible bad this afternoon, though. These
      headaches of mine are getting worse and worse. I’ll have to see a doctor
      about them. As for your chatter, I don’t know that I mind
      it—I’ve got so used to it.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Which was Marilla’s way of saying that she liked to hear it.

      CHAPTER XXVIII.<br>
      An Unfortunate Lily Maid</h2>
    
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>F course you must be
      Elaine, Anne,” said Diana. “I could never have the courage to float
      down there.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Nor I,” said Ruby Gillis, with a shiver. “I don’t mind
      floating down when there’s two or three of us in the flat and we can sit
      up. It’s fun then. But to lie down and pretend I was dead—I just
      couldn’t. I’d die really of fright.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Of course it would be romantic,” conceded Jane Andrews, “but
      I know I couldn’t keep still. I’d be popping up every minute or so
      to see where I was and if I wasn’t drifting too far out. And you know,
      Anne, that would spoil the effect.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “But it’s so ridiculous to have a redheaded Elaine,” mourned
      Anne. “I’m not afraid to float down and I’d love to be
      Elaine. But it’s ridiculous just the same. Ruby ought to be Elaine
      because she is so fair and has such lovely long golden hair—Elaine had
      ‘all her bright hair streaming down,’ you know. And Elaine was the
      lily maid. Now, a red-haired person cannot be a lily maid.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Your complexion is just as fair as Ruby’s,” said Diana
      earnestly, “and your hair is ever so much darker than it used to be
      before you cut it.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Oh, do you really think so?” exclaimed Anne, flushing sensitively
      with delight. “I’ve sometimes thought it was myself—but I
      never dared to ask anyone for fear she would tell me it wasn’t. Do you
      think it could be called auburn now, Diana?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Yes, and I think it is real pretty,” said Diana, looking
      admiringly at the short, silky curls that clustered over Anne’s head and
      were held in place by a very jaunty black velvet ribbon and bow.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      They were standing on the bank of the pond, below Orchard Slope, where a little
      headland fringed with birches ran out from the bank; at its tip was a small
      wooden platform built out into the water for the convenience of fishermen and
      duck hunters. Ruby and Jane were spending the midsummer afternoon with Diana,
      and Anne had come over to play with them.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Anne and Diana had spent most of their playtime that summer on and about the
      pond. Idlewild was a thing of the past, Mr. Bell having ruthlessly cut down the
      little circle of trees in his back pasture in the spring. Anne had sat among
      the stumps and wept, not without an eye to the romance of it; but she was
      speedily consoled, for, after all, as she and Diana said, big girls of
      thirteen, going on fourteen, were too old for such childish amusements as
      playhouses, and there were more fascinating sports to be found about the pond.
      It was splendid to fish for trout over the bridge and the two girls learned to
      row themselves about in the little flat-bottomed dory Mr. Barry kept for duck
      shooting.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      It was Anne’s idea that they dramatize Elaine. They had studied
      Tennyson’s poem in school the preceding winter, the Superintendent of
      Education having prescribed it in the English course for the Prince Edward
      Island schools. They had analyzed and parsed it and torn it to pieces in
      general until it was a wonder there was any meaning at all left in it for them,
      but at least the fair lily maid and Lancelot and Guinevere and King Arthur had
      become very real people to them, and Anne was devoured by secret regret that
      she had not been born in Camelot. Those days, she said, were so much more
      romantic than the present.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Anne’s plan was hailed with enthusiasm. The girls had discovered that if
      the flat were pushed off from the landing place it would drift down with the
      current under the bridge and finally strand itself on another headland lower
      down which ran out at a curve in the pond. They had often gone down like this
      and nothing could be more convenient for playing Elaine.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Well, I’ll be Elaine,” said Anne, yielding reluctantly, for,
      although she would have been delighted to play the principal character, yet her
      artistic sense demanded fitness for it and this, she felt, her limitations made
      impossible. “Ruby, you must be King Arthur and Jane will be Guinevere and
      Diana must be Lancelot. But first you must be the brothers and the father. We
      can’t have the old dumb servitor because there isn’t room for two
      in the flat when one is lying down. We must pall the barge all its length in
      blackest samite. That old black shawl of your mother’s will be just the
      thing, Diana.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The black shawl having been procured, Anne spread it over the flat and then lay
      down on the bottom, with closed eyes and hands folded over her breast.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Oh, she does look really dead,” whispered Ruby Gillis nervously,
      watching the still, white little face under the flickering shadows of the
      birches. “It makes me feel frightened, girls. Do you suppose it’s
      really right to act like this? Mrs. Lynde says that all play-acting is
      abominably wicked.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Ruby, you shouldn’t talk about Mrs. Lynde,” said Anne
      severely. “It spoils the effect because this is hundreds of years before
      Mrs. Lynde was born. Jane, you arrange this. It’s silly for Elaine to be
      talking when she’s dead.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Jane rose to the occasion. Cloth of gold for coverlet there was none, but an
      old piano scarf of yellow Japanese crepe was an excellent substitute. A white
      lily was not obtainable just then, but the effect of a tall blue iris placed in
      one of Anne’s folded hands was all that could be desired.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Now, she’s all ready,” said Jane. “We must kiss her
      quiet brows and, Diana, you say, ‘Sister, farewell forever,’ and
      Ruby, you say, ‘Farewell, sweet sister,’ both of you as sorrowfully
      as you possibly can. Anne, for goodness sake smile a little. You know Elaine
      ‘lay as though she smiled.’ That’s better. Now push the flat
      off.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The flat was accordingly pushed off, scraping roughly over an old embedded
      stake in the process. Diana and Jane and Ruby only waited long enough to see it
      caught in the current and headed for the bridge before scampering up through
      the woods, across the road, and down to the lower headland where, as Lancelot
      and Guinevere and the King, they were to be in readiness to receive the lily
      maid.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      For a few minutes Anne, drifting slowly down, enjoyed the romance of her
      situation to the full. Then something happened not at all romantic. The flat
      began to leak. In a very few moments it was necessary for Elaine to scramble to
      her feet, pick up her cloth of gold coverlet and pall of blackest samite and
      gaze blankly at a big crack in the bottom of her barge through which the water
      was literally pouring. That sharp stake at the landing had torn off the strip
      of batting nailed on the flat. Anne did not know this, but it did not take her
      long to realize that she was in a dangerous plight. At this rate the flat would
      fill and sink long before it could drift to the lower headland. Where were the
      oars? Left behind at the landing!
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Anne gave one gasping little scream which nobody ever heard; she was white to
      the lips, but she did not lose her self-possession. There was one
      chance—just one.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I was horribly frightened,” she told Mrs. Allan the next day,
      “and it seemed like years while the flat was drifting down to the bridge
      and the water rising in it every moment. I prayed, Mrs. Allan, most earnestly,
      but I didn’t shut my eyes to pray, for I knew the only way God could save
      me was to let the flat float close enough to one of the bridge piles for me to
      climb up on it. You know the piles are just old tree trunks and there are lots
      of knots and old branch stubs on them. It was proper to pray, but I had to do
      my part by watching out and right well I knew it. I just said, ‘Dear God,
      please take the flat close to a pile and I’ll do the rest,’ over
      and over again. Under such circumstances you don’t think much about
      making a flowery prayer. But mine was answered, for the flat bumped right into
      a pile for a minute and I flung the scarf and the shawl over my shoulder and
      scrambled up on a big providential stub. And there I was, Mrs. Allan, clinging
      to that slippery old pile with no way of getting up or down. It was a very
      unromantic position, but I didn’t think about that at the time. You
      don’t think much about romance when you have just escaped from a watery
      grave. I said a grateful prayer at once and then I gave all my attention to
      holding on tight, for I knew I should probably have to depend on human aid to
      get back to dry land.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The flat drifted under the bridge and then promptly sank in midstream. Ruby,
      Jane, and Diana, already awaiting it on the lower headland, saw it disappear
      before their very eyes and had not a doubt but that Anne had gone down with it.
      For a moment they stood still, white as sheets, frozen with horror at the
      tragedy; then, shrieking at the tops of their voices, they started on a frantic
      run up through the woods, never pausing as they crossed the main road to glance
      the way of the bridge. Anne, clinging desperately to her precarious foothold,
      saw their flying forms and heard their shrieks. Help would soon come, but
      meanwhile her position was a very uncomfortable one.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The minutes passed by, each seeming an hour to the unfortunate lily maid. Why
      didn’t somebody come? Where had the girls gone? Suppose they had fainted,
      one and all! Suppose nobody ever came! Suppose she grew so tired and cramped
      that she could hold on no longer! Anne looked at the wicked green depths below
      her, wavering with long, oily shadows, and shivered. Her imagination began to
      suggest all manner of gruesome possibilities to her.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Then, just as she thought she really could not endure the ache in her arms and
      wrists another moment, Gilbert Blythe came rowing under the bridge in Harmon
      Andrews’s dory!
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Gilbert glanced up and, much to his amazement, beheld a little white scornful
      face looking down upon him with big, frightened but also scornful gray eyes.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Anne Shirley! How on earth did you get there?” he exclaimed.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Without waiting for an answer he pulled close to the pile and extended his
      hand. There was no help for it; Anne, clinging to Gilbert Blythe’s hand,
      scrambled down into the dory, where she sat, drabbled and furious, in the stern
      with her arms full of dripping shawl and wet crepe. It was certainly extremely
      difficult to be dignified under the circumstances!
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “What has happened, Anne?” asked Gilbert, taking up his oars.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “We were playing Elaine,” explained Anne frigidly, without even
      looking at her rescuer, “and I had to drift down to Camelot in the
      barge—I mean the flat. The flat began to leak and I climbed out on the
      pile. The girls went for help. Will you be kind enough to row me to the
      landing?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Gilbert obligingly rowed to the landing and Anne, disdaining assistance, sprang
      nimbly on shore.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I’m very much obliged to you,” she said haughtily as she
      turned away. But Gilbert had also sprung from the boat and now laid a detaining
      hand on her arm.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Anne,” he said hurriedly, “look here. Can’t we be good
      friends? I’m awfully sorry I made fun of your hair that time. I
      didn’t mean to vex you and I only meant it for a joke. Besides,
      it’s so long ago. I think your hair is awfully pretty now—honest I
      do. Let’s be friends.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      For a moment Anne hesitated. She had an odd, newly awakened consciousness under
      all her outraged dignity that the half-shy, half-eager expression in
      Gilbert’s hazel eyes was something that was very good to see. Her heart
      gave a quick, queer little beat. But the bitterness of her old grievance
      promptly stiffened up her wavering determination. That scene of two years
      before flashed back into her recollection as vividly as if it had taken place
      yesterday. Gilbert had called her “carrots” and had brought about
      her disgrace before the whole school. Her resentment, which to other and older
      people might be as laughable as its cause, was in no whit allayed and softened
      by time seemingly. She hated Gilbert Blythe! She would never forgive him!
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “No,” she said coldly, “I shall never be friends with you,
      Gilbert Blythe; and I don’t want to be!”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “All right!” Gilbert sprang into his skiff with an angry color in
      his cheeks. “I’ll never ask you to be friends again, Anne Shirley.
      And I don’t care either!”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      He pulled away with swift defiant strokes, and Anne went up the steep, ferny
      little path under the maples. She held her head very high, but she was
      conscious of an odd feeling of regret. She almost wished she had answered
      Gilbert differently. Of course, he had insulted her terribly, but still—!
      Altogether, Anne rather thought it would be a relief to sit down and have a
      good cry. She was really quite unstrung, for the reaction from her fright and
      cramped clinging was making itself felt.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Halfway up the path she met Jane and Diana rushing back to the pond in a state
      narrowly removed from positive frenzy. They had found nobody at Orchard Slope,
      both Mr. and Mrs. Barry being away. Here Ruby Gillis had succumbed to
      hysterics, and was left to recover from them as best she might, while Jane and
      Diana flew through the Haunted Wood and across the brook to Green Gables. There
      they had found nobody either, for Marilla had gone to Carmody and Matthew was
      making hay in the back field.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Oh, Anne,” gasped Diana, fairly falling on the former’s neck
      and weeping with relief and delight, “oh, Anne—we thought—you
      were—drowned—and we felt like murderers—because we had
      made—you be—Elaine. And Ruby is in hysterics—oh, Anne, how
      did you escape?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I climbed up on one of the piles,” explained Anne wearily,
      “and Gilbert Blythe came along in Mr. Andrews’s dory and brought me
      to land.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Oh, Anne, how splendid of him! Why, it’s so romantic!” said
      Jane, finding breath enough for utterance at last. “Of course
      you’ll speak to him after this.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Of course I won’t,” flashed Anne, with a momentary return of
      her old spirit. “And I don’t want ever to hear the word
      ‘romantic’ again, Jane Andrews. I’m awfully sorry you were so
      frightened, girls. It is all my fault. I feel sure I was born under an unlucky
      star. Everything I do gets me or my dearest friends into a scrape. We’ve
      gone and lost your father’s flat, Diana, and I have a presentiment that
      we’ll not be allowed to row on the pond any more.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Anne’s presentiment proved more trustworthy than presentiments are apt to
      do. Great was the consternation in the Barry and Cuthbert households when the
      events of the afternoon became known.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Will you ever have any sense, Anne?” groaned Marilla.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Oh, yes, I think I will, Marilla,” returned Anne optimistically. A
      good cry, indulged in the grateful solitude of the east gable, had soothed her
      nerves and restored her to her wonted cheerfulness. “I think my prospects
      of becoming sensible are brighter now than ever.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I don’t see how,” said Marilla.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Well,” explained Anne, “I’ve learned a new and
      valuable lesson today. Ever since I came to Green Gables I’ve been making
      mistakes, and each mistake has helped to cure me of some great shortcoming. The
      affair of the amethyst brooch cured me of meddling with things that
      didn’t belong to me. The Haunted Wood mistake cured me of letting my
      imagination run away with me. The liniment cake mistake cured me of
      carelessness in cooking. Dyeing my hair cured me of vanity. I never think about
      my hair and nose now—at least, very seldom. And today’s mistake is
      going to cure me of being too romantic. I have come to the conclusion that it
      is no use trying to be romantic in Avonlea. It was probably easy enough in
      towered Camelot hundreds of years ago, but romance is not appreciated now. I
      feel quite sure that you will soon see a great improvement in me in this
      respect, Marilla.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I’m sure I hope so,” said Marilla skeptically.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      But Matthew, who had been sitting mutely in his corner, laid a hand on
      Anne’s shoulder when Marilla had gone out.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Don’t give up all your romance, Anne,” he whispered shyly,
      “a little of it is a good thing—not too much, of course—but
      keep a little of it, Anne, keep a little of it.”

      CHAPTER XXIX.<br>
      An Epoch in Anne’s Life</h2>
    
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>NNE was bringing the
      cows home from the back pasture by way of Lover’s Lane. It was a
      September evening and all the gaps and clearings in the woods were brimmed up
      with ruby sunset light. Here and there the lane was splashed with it, but for
      the most part it was already quite shadowy beneath the maples, and the spaces
      under the firs were filled with a clear violet dusk like airy wine. The winds
      were out in their tops, and there is no sweeter music on earth than that which
      the wind makes in the fir trees at evening.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The cows swung placidly down the lane, and Anne followed them dreamily,
      repeating aloud the battle canto from <i>Marmion</i>—which had also been
      part of their English course the preceding winter and which Miss Stacy had made
      them learn off by heart—and exulting in its rushing lines and the clash
      of spears in its imagery. When she came to the lines
    </p>
    
    <p class="poem">
      The stubborn spearsmen still made good<br>
      Their dark impenetrable wood,
    </p>
    
    <p class="noindent">
      she stopped in ecstasy to shut her eyes that she might the better fancy herself
      one of that heroic ring. When she opened them again it was to behold Diana
      coming through the gate that led into the Barry field and looking so important
      that Anne instantly divined there was news to be told. But betray too eager
      curiosity she would not.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Isn’t this evening just like a purple dream, Diana? It makes me so
      glad to be alive. In the mornings I always think the mornings are best; but
      when evening comes I think it’s lovelier still.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “It’s a very fine evening,” said Diana, “but oh, I have
      such news, Anne. Guess. You can have three guesses.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Charlotte Gillis is going to be married in the church after all and Mrs.
      Allan wants us to decorate it,” cried Anne.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “No. Charlotte’s beau won’t agree to that, because nobody
      ever has been married in the church yet, and he thinks it would seem too much
      like a funeral. It’s too mean, because it would be such fun. Guess
      again.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Jane’s mother is going to let her have a birthday party?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Diana shook her head, her black eyes dancing with merriment.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I can’t think what it can be,” said Anne in despair,
      “unless it’s that Moody Spurgeon MacPherson saw you home from
      prayer meeting last night. Did he?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I should think not,” exclaimed Diana indignantly. “I
      wouldn’t be likely to boast of it if he did, the horrid creature! I knew
      you couldn’t guess it. Mother had a letter from Aunt Josephine today, and
      Aunt Josephine wants you and me to go to town next Tuesday and stop with her
      for the Exhibition. There!”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Oh, Diana,” whispered Anne, finding it necessary to lean up
      against a maple tree for support, “do you really mean it? But I’m
      afraid Marilla won’t let me go. She will say that she can’t
      encourage gadding about. That was what she said last week when Jane invited me
      to go with them in their double-seated buggy to the American concert at the
      White Sands Hotel. I wanted to go, but Marilla said I’d be better at home
      learning my lessons and so would Jane. I was bitterly disappointed, Diana. I
      felt so heartbroken that I wouldn’t say my prayers when I went to bed.
      But I repented of that and got up in the middle of the night and said
      them.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I’ll tell you,” said Diana, “we’ll get Mother to
      ask Marilla. She’ll be more likely to let you go then; and if she does
      we’ll have the time of our lives, Anne. I’ve never been to an
      Exhibition, and it’s so aggravating to hear the other girls talking about
      their trips. Jane and Ruby have been twice, and they’re going this year
      again.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I’m not going to think about it at all until I know whether I can
      go or not,” said Anne resolutely. “If I did and then was
      disappointed, it would be more than I could bear. But in case I do go I’m
      very glad my new coat will be ready by that time. Marilla didn’t think I
      needed a new coat. She said my old one would do very well for another winter
      and that I ought to be satisfied with having a new dress. The dress is very
      pretty, Diana—navy blue and made so fashionably. Marilla always makes my
      dresses fashionably now, because she says she doesn’t intend to have
      Matthew going to Mrs. Lynde to make them. I’m so glad. It is ever so much
      easier to be good if your clothes are fashionable. At least, it is easier for
      me. I suppose it doesn’t make such a difference to naturally good people.
      But Matthew said I must have a new coat, so Marilla bought a lovely piece of
      blue broadcloth, and it’s being made by a real dressmaker over at
      Carmody. It’s to be done Saturday night, and I’m trying not to
      imagine myself walking up the church aisle on Sunday in my new suit and cap,
      because I’m afraid it isn’t right to imagine such things. But it
      just slips into my mind in spite of me. My cap is so pretty. Matthew bought it
      for me the day we were over at Carmody. It is one of those little blue velvet
      ones that are all the rage, with gold cord and tassels. Your new hat is
      elegant, Diana, and so becoming. When I saw you come into church last Sunday my
      heart swelled with pride to think you were my dearest friend. Do you suppose
      it’s wrong for us to think so much about our clothes? Marilla says it is
      very sinful. But it is such an interesting subject, isn’t it?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Marilla agreed to let Anne go to town, and it was arranged that Mr. Barry
      should take the girls in on the following Tuesday. As Charlottetown was thirty
      miles away and Mr. Barry wished to go and return the same day, it was necessary
      to make a very early start. But Anne counted it all joy, and was up before
      sunrise on Tuesday morning. A glance from her window assured her that the day
      would be fine, for the eastern sky behind the firs of the Haunted Wood was all
      silvery and cloudless. Through the gap in the trees a light was shining in the
      western gable of Orchard Slope, a token that Diana was also up.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Anne was dressed by the time Matthew had the fire on and had the breakfast
      ready when Marilla came down, but for her own part was much too excited to eat.
      After breakfast the jaunty new cap and jacket were donned, and Anne hastened
      over the brook and up through the firs to Orchard Slope. Mr. Barry and Diana
      were waiting for her, and they were soon on the road.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      It was a long drive, but Anne and Diana enjoyed every minute of it. It was
      delightful to rattle along over the moist roads in the early red sunlight that
      was creeping across the shorn harvest fields. The air was fresh and crisp, and
      little smoke-blue mists curled through the valleys and floated off from the
      hills. Sometimes the road went through woods where maples were beginning to
      hang out scarlet banners; sometimes it crossed rivers on bridges that made
      Anne’s flesh cringe with the old, half-delightful fear; sometimes it
      wound along a harbor shore and passed by a little cluster of weather-gray
      fishing huts; again it mounted to hills whence a far sweep of curving upland or
      misty-blue sky could be seen; but wherever it went there was much of interest
      to discuss. It was almost noon when they reached town and found their way to
      “Beechwood.” It was quite a fine old mansion, set back from the
      street in a seclusion of green elms and branching beeches. Miss Barry met them
      at the door with a twinkle in her sharp black eyes.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “So you’ve come to see me at last, you Anne-girl,” she said.
      “Mercy, child, how you have grown! You’re taller than I am, I
      declare. And you’re ever so much better-looking than you used to be, too.
      But I dare say you know that without being told.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Indeed I didn’t,” said Anne radiantly. “I know
      I’m not so freckled as I used to be, so I’ve much to be thankful
      for, but I really hadn’t dared to hope there was any other improvement.
      I’m so glad you think there is, Miss Barry.” Miss Barry’s
      house was furnished with “great magnificence,” as Anne told Marilla
      afterward. The two little country girls were rather abashed by the splendor of
      the parlor where Miss Barry left them when she went to see about dinner.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Isn’t it just like a palace?” whispered Diana. “I
      never was in Aunt Josephine’s house before, and I’d no idea it was
      so grand. I just wish Julia Bell could see this—she puts on such airs
      about her mother’s parlor.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Velvet carpet,” sighed Anne luxuriously, “and silk curtains!
      I’ve dreamed of such things, Diana. But do you know I don’t believe
      I feel very comfortable with them after all. There are so many things in this
      room and all so splendid that there is no scope for imagination. That is one
      consolation when you are poor—there are so many more things you can
      imagine about.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Their sojourn in town was something that Anne and Diana dated from for years.
      From first to last it was crowded with delights.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      On Wednesday Miss Barry took them to the Exhibition grounds and kept them there
      all day.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “It was splendid,” Anne related to Marilla later on. “I never
      imagined anything so interesting. I don’t really know which department
      was the most interesting. I think I liked the horses and the flowers and the
      fancywork best. Josie Pye took first prize for knitted lace. I was real glad
      she did. And I was glad that I felt glad, for it shows I’m improving,
      don’t you think, Marilla, when I can rejoice in Josie’s success?
      Mr. Harmon Andrews took second prize for Gravenstein apples and Mr. Bell took
      first prize for a pig. Diana said she thought it was ridiculous for a
      Sunday-school superintendent to take a prize in pigs, but I don’t see
      why. Do you? She said she would always think of it after this when he was
      praying so solemnly. Clara Louise MacPherson took a prize for painting, and
      Mrs. Lynde got first prize for homemade butter and cheese. So Avonlea was
      pretty well represented, wasn’t it? Mrs. Lynde was there that day, and I
      never knew how much I really liked her until I saw her familiar face among all
      those strangers. There were thousands of people there, Marilla. It made me feel
      dreadfully insignificant. And Miss Barry took us up to the grandstand to see
      the horse races. Mrs. Lynde wouldn’t go; she said horse racing was an
      abomination and, she being a church member, thought it her bounden duty to set
      a good example by staying away. But there were so many there I don’t
      believe Mrs. Lynde’s absence would ever be noticed. I don’t think,
      though, that I ought to go very often to horse races, because they <i>are</i>
      awfully fascinating. Diana got so excited that she offered to bet me ten cents
      that the red horse would win. I didn’t believe he would, but I refused to
      bet, because I wanted to tell Mrs. Allan all about everything, and I felt sure
      it wouldn’t do to tell her that. It’s always wrong to do anything
      you can’t tell the minister’s wife. It’s as good as an extra
      conscience to have a minister’s wife for your friend. And I was very glad
      I didn’t bet, because the red horse <i>did</i> win, and I would have lost
      ten cents. So you see that virtue was its own reward. We saw a man go up in a
      balloon. I’d love to go up in a balloon, Marilla; it would be simply
      thrilling; and we saw a man selling fortunes. You paid him ten cents and a
      little bird picked out your fortune for you. Miss Barry gave Diana and me ten
      cents each to have our fortunes told. Mine was that I would marry a
      dark-complected man who was very wealthy, and I would go across water to live.
      I looked carefully at all the dark men I saw after that, but I didn’t
      care much for any of them, and anyhow I suppose it’s too early to be
      looking out for him yet. Oh, it was a never-to-be-forgotten day, Marilla. I was
      so tired I couldn’t sleep at night. Miss Barry put us in the spare room,
      according to promise. It was an elegant room, Marilla, but somehow sleeping in
      a spare room isn’t what I used to think it was. That’s the worst of
      growing up, and I’m beginning to realize it. The things you wanted so
      much when you were a child don’t seem half so wonderful to you when you
      get them.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Thursday the girls had a drive in the park, and in the evening Miss Barry took
      them to a concert in the Academy of Music, where a noted prima donna was to
      sing. To Anne the evening was a glittering vision of delight.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Oh, Marilla, it was beyond description. I was so excited I
      couldn’t even talk, so you may know what it was like. I just sat in
      enraptured silence. Madame Selitsky was perfectly beautiful, and wore white
      satin and diamonds. But when she began to sing I never thought about anything
      else. Oh, I can’t tell you how I felt. But it seemed to me that it could
      never be hard to be good any more. I felt like I do when I look up to the
      stars. Tears came into my eyes, but, oh, they were such happy tears. I was so
      sorry when it was all over, and I told Miss Barry I didn’t see how I was
      ever to return to common life again. She said she thought if we went over to
      the restaurant across the street and had an ice cream it might help me. That
      sounded so prosaic; but to my surprise I found it true. The ice cream was
      delicious, Marilla, and it was so lovely and dissipated to be sitting there
      eating it at eleven o’clock at night. Diana said she believed she was
      born for city life. Miss Barry asked me what my opinion was, but I said I would
      have to think it over very seriously before I could tell her what I really
      thought. So I thought it over after I went to bed. That is the best time to
      think things out. And I came to the conclusion, Marilla, that I wasn’t
      born for city life and that I was glad of it. It’s nice to be eating ice
      cream at brilliant restaurants at eleven o’clock at night once in a
      while; but as a regular thing I’d rather be in the east gable at eleven,
      sound asleep, but kind of knowing even in my sleep that the stars were shining
      outside and that the wind was blowing in the firs across the brook. I told Miss
      Barry so at breakfast the next morning and she laughed. Miss Barry generally
      laughed at anything I said, even when I said the most solemn things. I
      don’t think I liked it, Marilla, because I wasn’t trying to be
      funny. But she is a most hospitable lady and treated us royally.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Friday brought going-home time, and Mr. Barry drove in for the girls.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Well, I hope you’ve enjoyed yourselves,” said Miss Barry, as
      she bade them good-bye.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Indeed we have,” said Diana.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “And you, Anne-girl?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I’ve enjoyed every minute of the time,” said Anne, throwing
      her arms impulsively about the old woman’s neck and kissing her wrinkled
      cheek. Diana would never have dared to do such a thing and felt rather aghast
      at Anne’s freedom. But Miss Barry was pleased, and she stood on her
      veranda and watched the buggy out of sight. Then she went back into her big
      house with a sigh. It seemed very lonely, lacking those fresh young lives. Miss
      Barry was a rather selfish old lady, if the truth must be told, and had never
      cared much for anybody but herself. She valued people only as they were of
      service to her or amused her. Anne had amused her, and consequently stood high
      in the old lady’s good graces. But Miss Barry found herself thinking less
      about Anne’s quaint speeches than of her fresh enthusiasms, her
      transparent emotions, her little winning ways, and the sweetness of her eyes
      and lips.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I thought Marilla Cuthbert was an old fool when I heard she’d
      adopted a girl out of an orphan asylum,” she said to herself, “but
      I guess she didn’t make much of a mistake after all. If I’d a child
      like Anne in the house all the time I’d be a better and happier
      woman.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Anne and Diana found the drive home as pleasant as the drive
      in—pleasanter, indeed, since there was the delightful consciousness of
      home waiting at the end of it. It was sunset when they passed through White
      Sands and turned into the shore road. Beyond, the Avonlea hills came out darkly
      against the saffron sky. Behind them the moon was rising out of the sea that
      grew all radiant and transfigured in her light. Every little cove along the
      curving road was a marvel of dancing ripples. The waves broke with a soft swish
      on the rocks below them, and the tang of the sea was in the strong, fresh air.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Oh, but it’s good to be alive and to be going home,”
      breathed Anne.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      When she crossed the log bridge over the brook the kitchen light of Green
      Gables winked her a friendly welcome back, and through the open door shone the
      hearth fire, sending out its warm red glow athwart the chilly autumn night.
      Anne ran blithely up the hill and into the kitchen, where a hot supper was
      waiting on the table.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “So you’ve got back?” said Marilla, folding up her knitting.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Yes, and oh, it’s so good to be back,” said Anne joyously.
      “I could kiss everything, even to the clock. Marilla, a broiled chicken!
      You don’t mean to say you cooked that for me!”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Yes, I did,” said Marilla. “I thought you’d be hungry
      after such a drive and need something real appetizing. Hurry and take off your
      things, and we’ll have supper as soon as Matthew comes in. I’m glad
      you’ve got back, I must say. It’s been fearful lonesome here
      without you, and I never put in four longer days.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      After supper Anne sat before the fire between Matthew and Marilla, and gave
      them a full account of her visit.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I’ve had a splendid time,” she concluded happily, “and
      I feel that it marks an epoch in my life. But the best of it all was the coming
      home.”

      CHAPTER XXX.<br>
      The Queen’s Class Is Organized</h2>
    
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>ARILLA laid her
      knitting on her lap and leaned back in her chair. Her eyes were tired, and she
      thought vaguely that she must see about having her glasses changed the next
      time she went to town, for her eyes had grown tired very often of late.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      It was nearly dark, for the full November twilight had fallen around Green
      Gables, and the only light in the kitchen came from the dancing red flames in
      the stove.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Anne was curled up Turk-fashion on the hearthrug, gazing into that joyous glow
      where the sunshine of a hundred summers was being distilled from the maple
      cordwood. She had been reading, but her book had slipped to the floor, and now
      she was dreaming, with a smile on her parted lips. Glittering castles in Spain
      were shaping themselves out of the mists and rainbows of her lively fancy;
      adventures wonderful and enthralling were happening to her in
      cloudland—adventures that always turned out triumphantly and never
      involved her in scrapes like those of actual life.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Marilla looked at her with a tenderness that would never have been suffered to
      reveal itself in any clearer light than that soft mingling of fireshine and
      shadow. The lesson of a love that should display itself easily in spoken word
      and open look was one Marilla could never learn. But she had learned to love
      this slim, gray-eyed girl with an affection all the deeper and stronger from
      its very undemonstrativeness. Her love made her afraid of being unduly
      indulgent, indeed. She had an uneasy feeling that it was rather sinful to set
      one’s heart so intensely on any human creature as she had set hers on
      Anne, and perhaps she performed a sort of unconscious penance for this by being
      stricter and more critical than if the girl had been less dear to her.
      Certainly Anne herself had no idea how Marilla loved her. She sometimes thought
      wistfully that Marilla was very hard to please and distinctly lacking in
      sympathy and understanding. But she always checked the thought reproachfully,
      remembering what she owed to Marilla.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Anne,” said Marilla abruptly, “Miss Stacy was here this
      afternoon when you were out with Diana.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Anne came back from her other world with a start and a sigh.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Was she? Oh, I’m so sorry I wasn’t in. Why didn’t you
      call me, Marilla? Diana and I were only over in the Haunted Wood. It’s
      lovely in the woods now. All the little wood things—the ferns and the
      satin leaves and the crackerberries—have gone to sleep, just as if
      somebody had tucked them away until spring under a blanket of leaves. I think
      it was a little gray fairy with a rainbow scarf that came tiptoeing along the
      last moonlight night and did it. Diana wouldn’t say much about that,
      though. Diana has never forgotten the scolding her mother gave her about
      imagining ghosts into the Haunted Wood. It had a very bad effect on
      Diana’s imagination. It blighted it. Mrs. Lynde says Myrtle Bell is a
      blighted being. I asked Ruby Gillis why Myrtle was blighted, and Ruby said she
      guessed it was because her young man had gone back on her. Ruby Gillis thinks
      of nothing but young men, and the older she gets the worse she is. Young men
      are all very well in their place, but it doesn’t do to drag them into
      everything, does it? Diana and I are thinking seriously of promising each other
      that we will never marry but be nice old maids and live together forever. Diana
      hasn’t quite made up her mind though, because she thinks perhaps it would
      be nobler to marry some wild, dashing, wicked young man and reform him. Diana
      and I talk a great deal about serious subjects now, you know. We feel that we
      are so much older than we used to be that it isn’t becoming to talk of
      childish matters. It’s such a solemn thing to be almost fourteen,
      Marilla. Miss Stacy took all us girls who are in our teens down to the brook
      last Wednesday, and talked to us about it. She said we couldn’t be too
      careful what habits we formed and what ideals we acquired in our teens, because
      by the time we were twenty our characters would be developed and the foundation
      laid for our whole future life. And she said if the foundation was shaky we
      could never build anything really worth while on it. Diana and I talked the
      matter over coming home from school. We felt extremely solemn, Marilla. And we
      decided that we would try to be very careful indeed and form respectable habits
      and learn all we could and be as sensible as possible, so that by the time we
      were twenty our characters would be properly developed. It’s perfectly
      appalling to think of being twenty, Marilla. It sounds so fearfully old and
      grown up. But why was Miss Stacy here this afternoon?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “That is what I want to tell you, Anne, if you’ll ever give me a
      chance to get a word in edgewise. She was talking about you.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “About me?” Anne looked rather scared. Then she flushed and
      exclaimed:
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Oh, I know what she was saying. I meant to tell you, Marilla, honestly I
      did, but I forgot. Miss Stacy caught me reading Ben Hur in school yesterday
      afternoon when I should have been studying my Canadian history. Jane Andrews
      lent it to me. I was reading it at dinner hour, and I had just got to the
      chariot race when school went in. I was simply wild to know how it turned
      out—although I felt sure Ben Hur must win, because it wouldn’t be
      poetical justice if he didn’t—so I spread the history open on my
      desk lid and then tucked Ben Hur between the desk and my knee. I just looked as
      if I were studying Canadian history, you know, while all the while I was
      reveling in Ben Hur. I was so interested in it that I never noticed Miss Stacy
      coming down the aisle until all at once I just looked up and there she was
      looking down at me, so reproachful-like. I can’t tell you how ashamed I
      felt, Marilla, especially when I heard Josie Pye giggling. Miss Stacy took Ben
      Hur away, but she never said a word then. She kept me in at recess and talked
      to me. She said I had done very wrong in two respects. First, I was wasting the
      time I ought to have put on my studies; and secondly, I was deceiving my
      teacher in trying to make it appear I was reading a history when it was a
      storybook instead. I had never realized until that moment, Marilla, that what I
      was doing was deceitful. I was shocked. I cried bitterly, and asked Miss Stacy
      to forgive me and I’d never do such a thing again; and I offered to do
      penance by never so much as looking at Ben Hur for a whole week, not even to
      see how the chariot race turned out. But Miss Stacy said she wouldn’t
      require that, and she forgave me freely. So I think it wasn’t very kind
      of her to come up here to you about it after all.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Miss Stacy never mentioned such a thing to me, Anne, and its only your
      guilty conscience that’s the matter with you. You have no business to be
      taking storybooks to school. You read too many novels anyhow. When I was a girl
      I wasn’t so much as allowed to look at a novel.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Oh, how can you call Ben Hur a novel when it’s really such a
      religious book?” protested Anne. “Of course it’s a little too
      exciting to be proper reading for Sunday, and I only read it on weekdays. And I
      never read <i>any</i> book now unless either Miss Stacy or Mrs. Allan thinks it
      is a proper book for a girl thirteen and three-quarters to read. Miss Stacy
      made me promise that. She found me reading a book one day called, The Lurid
      Mystery of the Haunted Hall. It was one Ruby Gillis had lent me, and, oh,
      Marilla, it was so fascinating and creepy. It just curdled the blood in my
      veins. But Miss Stacy said it was a very silly, unwholesome book, and she asked
      me not to read any more of it or any like it. I didn’t mind promising not
      to read any more like it, but it was <i>agonizing</i> to give back that book
      without knowing how it turned out. But my love for Miss Stacy stood the test
      and I did. It’s really wonderful, Marilla, what you can do when
      you’re truly anxious to please a certain person.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Well, I guess I’ll light the lamp and get to work,” said
      Marilla. “I see plainly that you don’t want to hear what Miss Stacy
      had to say. You’re more interested in the sound of your own tongue than
      in anything else.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Oh, indeed, Marilla, I do want to hear it,” cried Anne contritely.
      “I won’t say another word—not one. I know I talk too much,
      but I am really trying to overcome it, and although I say far too much, yet if
      you only knew how many things I want to say and don’t, you’d give
      me some credit for it. Please tell me, Marilla.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Well, Miss Stacy wants to organize a class among her advanced students
      who mean to study for the entrance examination into Queen’s. She intends
      to give them extra lessons for an hour after school. And she came to ask
      Matthew and me if we would like to have you join it. What do you think about it
      yourself, Anne? Would you like to go to Queen’s and pass for a
      teacher?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Oh, Marilla!” Anne straightened to her knees and clasped her
      hands. “It’s been the dream of my life—that is, for the last
      six months, ever since Ruby and Jane began to talk of studying for the
      Entrance. But I didn’t say anything about it, because I supposed it would
      be perfectly useless. I’d love to be a teacher. But won’t it be
      dreadfully expensive? Mr. Andrews says it cost him one hundred and fifty
      dollars to put Prissy through, and Prissy wasn’t a dunce in
      geometry.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I guess you needn’t worry about that part of it. When Matthew and
      I took you to bring up we resolved we would do the best we could for you and
      give you a good education. I believe in a girl being fitted to earn her own
      living whether she ever has to or not. You’ll always have a home at Green
      Gables as long as Matthew and I are here, but nobody knows what is going to
      happen in this uncertain world, and it’s just as well to be prepared. So
      you can join the Queen’s class if you like, Anne.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Oh, Marilla, thank you.” Anne flung her arms about Marilla’s
      waist and looked up earnestly into her face. “I’m extremely
      grateful to you and Matthew. And I’ll study as hard as I can and do my
      very best to be a credit to you. I warn you not to expect much in geometry, but
      I think I can hold my own in anything else if I work hard.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I dare say you’ll get along well enough. Miss Stacy says you are
      bright and diligent.” Not for worlds would Marilla have told Anne just
      what Miss Stacy had said about her; that would have been to pamper vanity.
      “You needn’t rush to any extreme of killing yourself over your
      books. There is no hurry. You won’t be ready to try the Entrance for a
      year and a half yet. But it’s well to begin in time and be thoroughly
      grounded, Miss Stacy says.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I shall take more interest than ever in my studies now,” said Anne
      blissfully, “because I have a purpose in life. Mr. Allan says everybody
      should have a purpose in life and pursue it faithfully. Only he says we must
      first make sure that it is a worthy purpose. I would call it a worthy purpose
      to want to be a teacher like Miss Stacy, wouldn’t you, Marilla? I think
      it’s a very noble profession.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The Queen’s class was organized in due time. Gilbert Blythe, Anne
      Shirley, Ruby Gillis, Jane Andrews, Josie Pye, Charlie Sloane, and Moody
      Spurgeon MacPherson joined it. Diana Barry did not, as her parents did not
      intend to send her to Queen’s. This seemed nothing short of a calamity to
      Anne. Never, since the night on which Minnie May had had the croup, had she and
      Diana been separated in anything. On the evening when the Queen’s class
      first remained in school for the extra lessons and Anne saw Diana go slowly out
      with the others, to walk home alone through the Birch Path and Violet Vale, it
      was all the former could do to keep her seat and refrain from rushing
      impulsively after her chum. A lump came into her throat, and she hastily
      retired behind the pages of her uplifted Latin grammar to hide the tears in her
      eyes. Not for worlds would Anne have had Gilbert Blythe or Josie Pye see those
      tears.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “But, oh, Marilla, I really felt that I had tasted the bitterness of
      death, as Mr. Allan said in his sermon last Sunday, when I saw Diana go out
      alone,” she said mournfully that night. “I thought how splendid it
      would have been if Diana had only been going to study for the Entrance, too.
      But we can’t have things perfect in this imperfect world, as Mrs. Lynde
      says. Mrs. Lynde isn’t exactly a comforting person sometimes, but
      there’s no doubt she says a great many very true things. And I think the
      Queen’s class is going to be extremely interesting. Jane and Ruby are
      just going to study to be teachers. That is the height of their ambition. Ruby
      says she will only teach for two years after she gets through, and then she
      intends to be married. Jane says she will devote her whole life to teaching,
      and never, never marry, because you are paid a salary for teaching, but a
      husband won’t pay you anything, and growls if you ask for a share in the
      egg and butter money. I expect Jane speaks from mournful experience, for Mrs.
      Lynde says that her father is a perfect old crank, and meaner than second
      skimmings. Josie Pye says she is just going to college for education’s
      sake, because she won’t have to earn her own living; she says of course
      it is different with orphans who are living on charity—<i>they</i> have
      to hustle. Moody Spurgeon is going to be a minister. Mrs. Lynde says he
      couldn’t be anything else with a name like that to live up to. I hope it
      isn’t wicked of me, Marilla, but really the thought of Moody Spurgeon
      being a minister makes me laugh. He’s such a funny-looking boy with that
      big fat face, and his little blue eyes, and his ears sticking out like flaps.
      But perhaps he will be more intellectual-looking when he grows up. Charlie
      Sloane says he’s going to go into politics and be a member of Parliament,
      but Mrs. Lynde says he’ll never succeed at that, because the Sloanes are
      all honest people, and it’s only rascals that get on in politics
      nowadays.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “What is Gilbert Blythe going to be?” queried Marilla, seeing that
      Anne was opening her Cæsar.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I don’t happen to know what Gilbert Blythe’s ambition in
      life is—if he has any,” said Anne scornfully.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      There was open rivalry between Gilbert and Anne now. Previously the rivalry had
      been rather one-sided, but there was no longer any doubt that Gilbert was as
      determined to be first in class as Anne was. He was a foeman worthy of her
      steel. The other members of the class tacitly acknowledged their superiority,
      and never dreamed of trying to compete with them.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Since the day by the pond when she had refused to listen to his plea for
      forgiveness, Gilbert, save for the aforesaid determined rivalry, had evinced no
      recognition whatever of the existence of Anne Shirley. He talked and jested
      with the other girls, exchanged books and puzzles with them, discussed lessons
      and plans, sometimes walked home with one or the other of them from prayer
      meeting or Debating Club. But Anne Shirley he simply ignored, and Anne found
      out that it is not pleasant to be ignored. It was in vain that she told herself
      with a toss of her head that she did not care. Deep down in her wayward,
      feminine little heart she knew that she did care, and that if she had that
      chance of the Lake of Shining Waters again she would answer very differently.
      All at once, as it seemed, and to her secret dismay, she found that the old
      resentment she had cherished against him was gone—gone just when she most
      needed its sustaining power. It was in vain that she recalled every incident
      and emotion of that memorable occasion and tried to feel the old satisfying
      anger. That day by the pond had witnessed its last spasmodic flicker. Anne
      realized that she had forgiven and forgotten without knowing it. But it was too
      late.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      And at least neither Gilbert nor anybody else, not even Diana, should ever
      suspect how sorry she was and how much she wished she hadn’t been so
      proud and horrid! She determined to “shroud her feelings in deepest
      oblivion,” and it may be stated here and now that she did it, so
      successfully that Gilbert, who possibly was not quite so indifferent as he
      seemed, could not console himself with any belief that Anne felt his
      retaliatory scorn. The only poor comfort he had was that she snubbed Charlie
      Sloane, unmercifully, continually, and undeservedly.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Otherwise the winter passed away in a round of pleasant duties and studies. For
      Anne the days slipped by like golden beads on the necklace of the year. She was
      happy, eager, interested; there were lessons to be learned and honor to be won;
      delightful books to read; new pieces to be practiced for the Sunday-school
      choir; pleasant Saturday afternoons at the manse with Mrs. Allan; and then,
      almost before Anne realized it, spring had come again to Green Gables and all
      the world was abloom once more.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Studies palled just a wee bit then; the Queen’s class, left behind in
      school while the others scattered to green lanes and leafy wood cuts and meadow
      byways, looked wistfully out of the windows and discovered that Latin verbs and
      French exercises had somehow lost the tang and zest they had possessed in the
      crisp winter months. Even Anne and Gilbert lagged and grew indifferent. Teacher
      and taught were alike glad when the term was ended and the glad vacation days
      stretched rosily before them.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “But you’ve done good work this past year,” Miss Stacy told
      them on the last evening, “and you deserve a good, jolly vacation. Have
      the best time you can in the out-of-door world and lay in a good stock of
      health and vitality and ambition to carry you through next year. It will be the
      tug of war, you know—the last year before the Entrance.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Are you going to be back next year, Miss Stacy?” asked Josie Pye.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Josie Pye never scrupled to ask questions; in this instance the rest of the
      class felt grateful to her; none of them would have dared to ask it of Miss
      Stacy, but all wanted to, for there had been alarming rumors running at large
      through the school for some time that Miss Stacy was not coming back the next
      year—that she had been offered a position in the grade school of her own
      home district and meant to accept. The Queen’s class listened in
      breathless suspense for her answer.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Yes, I think I will,” said Miss Stacy. “I thought of taking
      another school, but I have decided to come back to Avonlea. To tell the truth,
      I’ve grown so interested in my pupils here that I found I couldn’t
      leave them. So I’ll stay and see you through.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Hurrah!” said Moody Spurgeon. Moody Spurgeon had never been so
      carried away by his feelings before, and he blushed uncomfortably every time he
      thought about it for a week.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Oh, I’m so glad,” said Anne, with shining eyes. “Dear
      Stacy, it would be perfectly dreadful if you didn’t come back. I
      don’t believe I could have the heart to go on with my studies at all if
      another teacher came here.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      When Anne got home that night she stacked all her textbooks away in an old
      trunk in the attic, locked it, and threw the key into the blanket box.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I’m not even going to look at a schoolbook in vacation,” she
      told Marilla. “I’ve studied as hard all the term as I possibly
      could and I’ve pored over that geometry until I know every proposition in
      the first book off by heart, even when the letters <i>are</i> changed. I just
      feel tired of everything sensible and I’m going to let my imagination run
      riot for the summer. Oh, you needn’t be alarmed, Marilla. I’ll only
      let it run riot within reasonable limits. But I want to have a real good jolly
      time this summer, for maybe it’s the last summer I’ll be a little
      girl. Mrs. Lynde says that if I keep stretching out next year as I’ve
      done this I’ll have to put on longer skirts. She says I’m all
      running to legs and eyes. And when I put on longer skirts I shall feel that I
      have to live up to them and be very dignified. It won’t even do to
      believe in fairies then, I’m afraid; so I’m going to believe in
      them with all my whole heart this summer. I think we’re going to have a
      very gay vacation. Ruby Gillis is going to have a birthday party soon and
      there’s the Sunday-school picnic and the missionary concert next month.
      And Mr. Barry says that some evening he’ll take Diana and me over to the
      White Sands Hotel and have dinner there. They have dinner there in the evening,
      you know. Jane Andrews was over once last summer and she says it was a dazzling
      sight to see the electric lights and the flowers and all the lady guests in
      such beautiful dresses. Jane says it was her first glimpse into high life and
      she’ll never forget it to her dying day.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Mrs. Lynde came up the next afternoon to find out why Marilla had not been at
      the Aid meeting on Thursday. When Marilla was not at Aid meeting people knew
      there was something wrong at Green Gables.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Matthew had a bad spell with his heart Thursday,” Marilla
      explained, “and I didn’t feel like leaving him. Oh, yes, he’s
      all right again now, but he takes them spells oftener than he used to and
      I’m anxious about him. The doctor says he must be careful to avoid
      excitement. That’s easy enough, for Matthew doesn’t go about
      looking for excitement by any means and never did, but he’s not to do any
      very heavy work either and you might as well tell Matthew not to breathe as not
      to work. Come and lay off your things, Rachel. You’ll stay to tea?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Well, seeing you’re so pressing, perhaps I might as well,
      stay” said Mrs. Rachel, who had not the slightest intention of doing
      anything else.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Mrs. Rachel and Marilla sat comfortably in the parlor while Anne got the tea
      and made hot biscuits that were light and white enough to defy even Mrs.
      Rachel’s criticism.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I must say Anne has turned out a real smart girl,” admitted Mrs.
      Rachel, as Marilla accompanied her to the end of the lane at sunset. “She
      must be a great help to you.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “She is,” said Marilla, “and she’s real steady and
      reliable now. I used to be afraid she’d never get over her featherbrained
      ways, but she has and I wouldn’t be afraid to trust her in anything
      now.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I never would have thought she’d have turned out so well that
      first day I was here three years ago,” said Mrs. Rachel. “Lawful
      heart, shall I ever forget that tantrum of hers! When I went home that night I
      says to Thomas, says I, ‘Mark my words, Thomas, Marilla Cuthbert
      ‘ll live to rue the step she’s took.’ But I was mistaken and
      I’m real glad of it. I ain’t one of those kind of people, Marilla,
      as can never be brought to own up that they’ve made a mistake. No, that
      never was my way, thank goodness. I did make a mistake in judging Anne, but it
      weren’t no wonder, for an odder, unexpecteder witch of a child there
      never was in this world, that’s what. There was no ciphering her out by
      the rules that worked with other children. It’s nothing short of
      wonderful how she’s improved these three years, but especially in looks.
      She’s a real pretty girl got to be, though I can’t say I’m
      overly partial to that pale, big-eyed style myself. I like more snap and color,
      like Diana Barry has or Ruby Gillis. Ruby Gillis’s looks are real showy.
      But somehow—I don’t know how it is but when Anne and them are
      together, though she ain’t half as handsome, she makes them look kind of
      common and overdone—something like them white June lilies she calls
      narcissus alongside of the big, red peonies, that’s what.”

      CHAPTER XXXI.<br>
      Where the Brook and River Meet</h2>
    
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>NNE had her
      “good” summer and enjoyed it wholeheartedly. She and Diana fairly
      lived outdoors, reveling in all the delights that Lover’s Lane and the
      Dryad’s Bubble and Willowmere and Victoria Island afforded. Marilla
      offered no objections to Anne’s gypsyings. The Spencervale doctor who had
      come the night Minnie May had the croup met Anne at the house of a patient one
      afternoon early in vacation, looked her over sharply, screwed up his mouth,
      shook his head, and sent a message to Marilla Cuthbert by another person. It
      was:
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Keep that redheaded girl of yours in the open air all summer and
      don’t let her read books until she gets more spring into her step.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      This message frightened Marilla wholesomely. She read Anne’s death
      warrant by consumption in it unless it was scrupulously obeyed. As a result,
      Anne had the golden summer of her life as far as freedom and frolic went. She
      walked, rowed, berried, and dreamed to her heart’s content; and when
      September came she was bright-eyed and alert, with a step that would have
      satisfied the Spencervale doctor and a heart full of ambition and zest once
      more.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I feel just like studying with might and main,” she declared as
      she brought her books down from the attic. “Oh, you good old friends,
      I’m glad to see your honest faces once more—yes, even you,
      geometry. I’ve had a perfectly beautiful summer, Marilla, and now
      I’m rejoicing as a strong man to run a race, as Mr. Allan said last
      Sunday. Doesn’t Mr. Allan preach magnificent sermons? Mrs. Lynde says he
      is improving every day and the first thing we know some city church will gobble
      him up and then we’ll be left and have to turn to and break in another
      green preacher. But I don’t see the use of meeting trouble halfway, do
      you, Marilla? I think it would be better just to enjoy Mr. Allan while we have
      him. If I were a man I think I’d be a minister. They can have such an
      influence for good, if their theology is sound; and it must be thrilling to
      preach splendid sermons and stir your hearers’ hearts. Why can’t
      women be ministers, Marilla? I asked Mrs. Lynde that and she was shocked and
      said it would be a scandalous thing. She said there might be female ministers
      in the States and she believed there was, but thank goodness we hadn’t
      got to that stage in Canada yet and she hoped we never would. But I don’t
      see why. I think women would make splendid ministers. When there is a social to
      be got up or a church tea or anything else to raise money the women have to
      turn to and do the work. I’m sure Mrs. Lynde can pray every bit as well
      as Superintendent Bell and I’ve no doubt she could preach too with a
      little practice.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Yes, I believe she could,” said Marilla dryly. “She does
      plenty of unofficial preaching as it is. Nobody has much of a chance to go
      wrong in Avonlea with Rachel to oversee them.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Marilla,” said Anne in a burst of confidence, “I want to
      tell you something and ask you what you think about it. It has worried me
      terribly—on Sunday afternoons, that is, when I think specially about such
      matters. I do really want to be good; and when I’m with you or Mrs. Allan
      or Miss Stacy I want it more than ever and I want to do just what would please
      you and what you would approve of. But mostly when I’m with Mrs. Lynde I
      feel desperately wicked and as if I wanted to go and do the very thing she
      tells me I oughtn’t to do. I feel irresistibly tempted to do it. Now,
      what do you think is the reason I feel like that? Do you think it’s
      because I’m really bad and unregenerate?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Marilla looked dubious for a moment. Then she laughed.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “If you are I guess I am too, Anne, for Rachel often has that very effect
      on me. I sometimes think she’d have more of an influence for good, as you
      say yourself, if she didn’t keep nagging people to do right. There should
      have been a special commandment against nagging. But there, I shouldn’t
      talk so. Rachel is a good Christian woman and she means well. There isn’t
      a kinder soul in Avonlea and she never shirks her share of work.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I’m very glad you feel the same,” said Anne decidedly.
      “It’s so encouraging. I shan’t worry so much over that after
      this. But I dare say there’ll be other things to worry me. They keep
      coming up new all the time—things to perplex you, you know. You settle
      one question and there’s another right after. There are so many things to
      be thought over and decided when you’re beginning to grow up. It keeps me
      busy all the time thinking them over and deciding what is right. It’s a
      serious thing to grow up, isn’t it, Marilla? But when I have such good
      friends as you and Matthew and Mrs. Allan and Miss Stacy I ought to grow up
      successfully, and I’m sure it will be my own fault if I don’t. I
      feel it’s a great responsibility because I have only the one chance. If I
      don’t grow up right I can’t go back and begin over again.
      I’ve grown two inches this summer, Marilla. Mr. Gillis measured me at
      Ruby’s party. I’m so glad you made my new dresses longer. That
      dark-green one is so pretty and it was sweet of you to put on the flounce. Of
      course I know it wasn’t really necessary, but flounces are so stylish
      this fall and Josie Pye has flounces on all her dresses. I know I’ll be
      able to study better because of mine. I shall have such a comfortable feeling
      deep down in my mind about that flounce.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “It’s worth something to have that,” admitted Marilla.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Miss Stacy came back to Avonlea school and found all her pupils eager for work
      once more. Especially did the Queen’s class gird up their loins for the
      fray, for at the end of the coming year, dimly shadowing their pathway already,
      loomed up that fateful thing known as “the Entrance,” at the
      thought of which one and all felt their hearts sink into their very shoes.
      Suppose they did not pass! That thought was doomed to haunt Anne through the
      waking hours of that winter, Sunday afternoons inclusive, to the almost entire
      exclusion of moral and theological problems. When Anne had bad dreams she found
      herself staring miserably at pass lists of the Entrance exams, where Gilbert
      Blythe’s name was blazoned at the top and in which hers did not appear at
      all.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      But it was a jolly, busy, happy swift-flying winter. Schoolwork was as
      interesting, class rivalry as absorbing, as of yore. New worlds of thought,
      feeling, and ambition, fresh, fascinating fields of unexplored knowledge seemed
      to be opening out before Anne’s eager eyes.
    </p>
    
    <p class="poem">
      “Hills peeped o’er hill and Alps on Alps arose.”
    </p>
    
    <p class="noindent">
      Much of all this was due to Miss Stacy’s tactful, careful, broadminded
      guidance. She led her class to think and explore and discover for themselves
      and encouraged straying from the old beaten paths to a degree that quite
      shocked Mrs. Lynde and the school trustees, who viewed all innovations on
      established methods rather dubiously.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Apart from her studies Anne expanded socially, for Marilla, mindful of the
      Spencervale doctor’s dictum, no longer vetoed occasional outings. The
      Debating Club flourished and gave several concerts; there were one or two
      parties almost verging on grown-up affairs; there were sleigh drives and
      skating frolics galore.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Between times Anne grew, shooting up so rapidly that Marilla was astonished one
      day, when they were standing side by side, to find the girl was taller than
      herself.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Why, Anne, how you’ve grown!” she said, almost
      unbelievingly. A sigh followed on the words. Marilla felt a queer regret over
      Anne’s inches. The child she had learned to love had vanished somehow and
      here was this tall, serious-eyed girl of fifteen, with the thoughtful brows and
      the proudly poised little head, in her place. Marilla loved the girl as much as
      she had loved the child, but she was conscious of a queer sorrowful sense of
      loss. And that night, when Anne had gone to prayer meeting with Diana, Marilla
      sat alone in the wintry twilight and indulged in the weakness of a cry.
      Matthew, coming in with a lantern, caught her at it and gazed at her in such
      consternation that Marilla had to laugh through her tears.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I was thinking about Anne,” she explained. “She’s got
      to be such a big girl—and she’ll probably be away from us next
      winter. I’ll miss her terrible.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “She’ll be able to come home often,” comforted Matthew, to
      whom Anne was as yet and always would be the little, eager girl he had brought
      home from Bright River on that June evening four years before. “The
      branch railroad will be built to Carmody by that time.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “It won’t be the same thing as having her here all the time,”
      sighed Marilla gloomily, determined to enjoy her luxury of grief uncomforted.
      “But there—men can’t understand these things!”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      There were other changes in Anne no less real than the physical change. For one
      thing, she became much quieter. Perhaps she thought all the more and dreamed as
      much as ever, but she certainly talked less. Marilla noticed and commented on
      this also.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “You don’t chatter half as much as you used to, Anne, nor use half
      as many big words. What has come over you?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Anne colored and laughed a little, as she dropped her book and looked dreamily
      out of the window, where big fat red buds were bursting out on the creeper in
      response to the lure of the spring sunshine.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I don’t know—I don’t want to talk as much,” she
      said, denting her chin thoughtfully with her forefinger. “It’s
      nicer to think dear, pretty thoughts and keep them in one’s heart, like
      treasures. I don’t like to have them laughed at or wondered over. And
      somehow I don’t want to use big words any more. It’s almost a pity,
      isn’t it, now that I’m really growing big enough to say them if I
      did want to. It’s fun to be almost grown up in some ways, but it’s
      not the kind of fun I expected, Marilla. There’s so much to learn and do
      and think that there isn’t time for big words. Besides, Miss Stacy says
      the short ones are much stronger and better. She makes us write all our essays
      as simply as possible. It was hard at first. I was so used to crowding in all
      the fine big words I could think of—and I thought of any number of them.
      But I’ve got used to it now and I see it’s so much better.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “What has become of your story club? I haven’t heard you speak of
      it for a long time.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “The story club isn’t in existence any longer. We hadn’t time
      for it—and anyhow I think we had got tired of it. It was silly to be
      writing about love and murder and elopements and mysteries. Miss Stacy
      sometimes has us write a story for training in composition, but she won’t
      let us write anything but what might happen in Avonlea in our own lives, and
      she criticizes it very sharply and makes us criticize our own too. I never
      thought my compositions had so many faults until I began to look for them
      myself. I felt so ashamed I wanted to give up altogether, but Miss Stacy said I
      could learn to write well if I only trained myself to be my own severest
      critic. And so I am trying to.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “You’ve only two more months before the Entrance,” said
      Marilla. “Do you think you’ll be able to get through?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Anne shivered.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I don’t know. Sometimes I think I’ll be all right—and
      then I get horribly afraid. We’ve studied hard and Miss Stacy has drilled
      us thoroughly, but we mayn’t get through for all that. We’ve each
      got a stumbling block. Mine is geometry of course, and Jane’s is Latin,
      and Ruby and Charlie’s is algebra, and Josie’s is arithmetic. Moody
      Spurgeon says he feels it in his bones that he is going to fail in English
      history. Miss Stacy is going to give us examinations in June just as hard as
      we’ll have at the Entrance and mark us just as strictly, so we’ll
      have some idea. I wish it was all over, Marilla. It haunts me. Sometimes I wake
      up in the night and wonder what I’ll do if I don’t pass.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Why, go to school next year and try again,” said Marilla
      unconcernedly.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Oh, I don’t believe I’d have the heart for it. It would be
      such a disgrace to fail, especially if Gil—if the others passed. And I
      get so nervous in an examination that I’m likely to make a mess of it. I
      wish I had nerves like Jane Andrews. Nothing rattles her.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Anne sighed and, dragging her eyes from the witcheries of the spring world, the
      beckoning day of breeze and blue, and the green things upspringing in the
      garden, buried herself resolutely in her book. There would be other springs,
      but if she did not succeed in passing the Entrance, Anne felt convinced that
      she would never recover sufficiently to enjoy them.

      CHAPTER XXXII.<br>
      The Pass List Is Out</h2>
    
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>ITH the end of June
      came the close of the term and the close of Miss Stacy’s rule in Avonlea
      school. Anne and Diana walked home that evening feeling very sober indeed. Red
      eyes and damp handkerchiefs bore convincing testimony to the fact that Miss
      Stacy’s farewell words must have been quite as touching as Mr.
      Phillips’s had been under similar circumstances three years before. Diana
      looked back at the schoolhouse from the foot of the spruce hill and sighed
      deeply.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “It does seem as if it was the end of everything, doesn’t
      it?” she said dismally.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “You oughtn’t to feel half as badly as I do,” said Anne,
      hunting vainly for a dry spot on her handkerchief. “You’ll be back
      again next winter, but I suppose I’ve left the dear old school
      forever—if I have good luck, that is.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “It won’t be a bit the same. Miss Stacy won’t be there, nor
      you nor Jane nor Ruby probably. I shall have to sit all alone, for I
      couldn’t bear to have another deskmate after you. Oh, we have had jolly
      times, haven’t we, Anne? It’s dreadful to think they’re all
      over.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Two big tears rolled down by Diana’s nose.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “If you would stop crying I could,” said Anne imploringly.
      “Just as soon as I put away my hanky I see you brimming up and that
      starts me off again. As Mrs. Lynde says, ‘If you can’t be cheerful,
      be as cheerful as you can.’ After all, I dare say I’ll be back next
      year. This is one of the times I <i>know</i> I’m not going to pass.
      They’re getting alarmingly frequent.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Why, you came out splendidly in the exams Miss Stacy gave.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Yes, but those exams didn’t make me nervous. When I think of the
      real thing you can’t imagine what a horrid cold fluttery feeling comes
      round my heart. And then my number is thirteen and Josie Pye says it’s so
      unlucky. I am <i>not</i> superstitious and I know it can make no difference.
      But still I wish it wasn’t thirteen.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I do wish I was going in with you,” said Diana.
      “Wouldn’t we have a perfectly elegant time? But I suppose
      you’ll have to cram in the evenings.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “No; Miss Stacy has made us promise not to open a book at all. She says
      it would only tire and confuse us and we are to go out walking and not think
      about the exams at all and go to bed early. It’s good advice, but I
      expect it will be hard to follow; good advice is apt to be, I think. Prissy
      Andrews told me that she sat up half the night every night of her Entrance week
      and crammed for dear life; and I had determined to sit up <i>at least</i> as
      long as she did. It was so kind of your Aunt Josephine to ask me to stay at
      Beechwood while I’m in town.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “You’ll write to me while you’re in, won’t you?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I’ll write Tuesday night and tell you how the first day
      goes,” promised Anne.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I’ll be haunting the post office Wednesday,” vowed Diana.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Anne went to town the following Monday and on Wednesday Diana haunted the post
      office, as agreed, and got her letter.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Dearest Diana” [wrote Anne],
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Here it is Tuesday night and I’m writing this in the library at
      Beechwood. Last night I was horribly lonesome all alone in my room and wished
      so much you were with me. I couldn’t ‘cram’ because I’d
      promised Miss Stacy not to, but it was as hard to keep from opening my history
      as it used to be to keep from reading a story before my lessons were learned.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “This morning Miss Stacy came for me and we went to the Academy, calling
      for Jane and Ruby and Josie on our way. Ruby asked me to feel her hands and
      they were as cold as ice. Josie said I looked as if I hadn’t slept a wink
      and she didn’t believe I was strong enough to stand the grind of the
      teacher’s course even if I did get through. There are times and seasons
      even yet when I don’t feel that I’ve made any great headway in
      learning to like Josie Pye!
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “When we reached the Academy there were scores of students there from all
      over the Island. The first person we saw was Moody Spurgeon sitting on the
      steps and muttering away to himself. Jane asked him what on earth he was doing
      and he said he was repeating the multiplication table over and over to steady
      his nerves and for pity’s sake not to interrupt him, because if he
      stopped for a moment he got frightened and forgot everything he ever knew, but
      the multiplication table kept all his facts firmly in their proper place!
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “When we were assigned to our rooms Miss Stacy had to leave us. Jane and
      I sat together and Jane was so composed that I envied her. No need of the
      multiplication table for good, steady, sensible Jane! I wondered if I looked as
      I felt and if they could hear my heart thumping clear across the room. Then a
      man came in and began distributing the English examination sheets. My hands
      grew cold then and my head fairly whirled around as I picked it up. Just one
      awful moment—Diana, I felt exactly as I did four years ago when I asked
      Marilla if I might stay at Green Gables—and then everything cleared up in
      my mind and my heart began beating again—I forgot to say that it had
      stopped altogether!—for I knew I could do something with <i>that</i>
      paper anyhow.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “At noon we went home for dinner and then back again for history in the
      afternoon. The history was a pretty hard paper and I got dreadfully mixed up in
      the dates. Still, I think I did fairly well today. But oh, Diana, tomorrow the
      geometry exam comes off and when I think of it it takes every bit of
      determination I possess to keep from opening my Euclid. If I thought the
      multiplication table would help me any I would recite it from now till tomorrow
      morning.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I went down to see the other girls this evening. On my way I met Moody
      Spurgeon wandering distractedly around. He said he knew he had failed in
      history and he was born to be a disappointment to his parents and he was going
      home on the morning train; and it would be easier to be a carpenter than a
      minister, anyhow. I cheered him up and persuaded him to stay to the end because
      it would be unfair to Miss Stacy if he didn’t. Sometimes I have wished I
      was born a boy, but when I see Moody Spurgeon I’m always glad I’m a
      girl and not his sister.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Ruby was in hysterics when I reached their boarding-house; she had just
      discovered a fearful mistake she had made in her English paper. When she
      recovered we went uptown and had an ice cream. How we wished you had been with
      us.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Oh, Diana, if only the geometry examination were over! But there, as
      Mrs. Lynde would say, the sun will go on rising and setting whether I fail in
      geometry or not. That is true but not especially comforting. I think I’d
      rather it didn’t go on if I failed!
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Yours devotedly,
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Anne”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The geometry examination and all the others were over in due time and Anne
      arrived home on Friday evening, rather tired but with an air of chastened
      triumph about her. Diana was over at Green Gables when she arrived and they met
      as if they had been parted for years.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “You old darling, it’s perfectly splendid to see you back again. It
      seems like an age since you went to town and oh, Anne, how did you get
      along?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Pretty well, I think, in everything but the geometry. I don’t know
      whether I passed in it or not and I have a creepy, crawly presentiment that I
      didn’t. Oh, how good it is to be back! Green Gables is the dearest,
      loveliest spot in the world.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “How did the others do?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “The girls say they know they didn’t pass, but I think they did
      pretty well. Josie says the geometry was so easy a child of ten could do it!
      Moody Spurgeon still thinks he failed in history and Charlie says he failed in
      algebra. But we don’t really know anything about it and won’t until
      the pass list is out. That won’t be for a fortnight. Fancy living a
      fortnight in such suspense! I wish I could go to sleep and never wake up until
      it is over.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Diana knew it would be useless to ask how Gilbert Blythe had fared, so she
      merely said:
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Oh, you’ll pass all right. Don’t worry.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I’d rather not pass at all than not come out pretty well up on the
      list,” flashed Anne, by which she meant—and Diana knew she
      meant—that success would be incomplete and bitter if she did not come out
      ahead of Gilbert Blythe.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      With this end in view Anne had strained every nerve during the examinations. So
      had Gilbert. They had met and passed each other on the street a dozen times
      without any sign of recognition and every time Anne had held her head a little
      higher and wished a little more earnestly that she had made friends with
      Gilbert when he asked her, and vowed a little more determinedly to surpass him
      in the examination. She knew that all Avonlea junior was wondering which would
      come out first; she even knew that Jimmy Glover and Ned Wright had a bet on the
      question and that Josie Pye had said there was no doubt in the world that
      Gilbert would be first; and she felt that her humiliation would be unbearable
      if she failed.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      But she had another and nobler motive for wishing to do well. She wanted to
      “pass high” for the sake of Matthew and Marilla—especially
      Matthew. Matthew had declared to her his conviction that she “would beat
      the whole Island.” That, Anne felt, was something it would be foolish to
      hope for even in the wildest dreams. But she did hope fervently that she would
      be among the first ten at least, so that she might see Matthew’s kindly
      brown eyes gleam with pride in her achievement. That, she felt, would be a
      sweet reward indeed for all her hard work and patient grubbing among
      unimaginative equations and conjugations.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      At the end of the fortnight Anne took to “haunting” the post office
      also, in the distracted company of Jane, Ruby, and Josie, opening the
      Charlottetown dailies with shaking hands and cold, sinkaway feelings as bad as
      any experienced during the Entrance week. Charlie and Gilbert were not above
      doing this too, but Moody Spurgeon stayed resolutely away.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I haven’t got the grit to go there and look at a paper in cold
      blood,” he told Anne. “I’m just going to wait until somebody
      comes and tells me suddenly whether I’ve passed or not.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      When three weeks had gone by without the pass list appearing Anne began to feel
      that she really couldn’t stand the strain much longer. Her appetite
      failed and her interest in Avonlea doings languished. Mrs. Lynde wanted to know
      what else you could expect with a Tory superintendent of education at the head
      of affairs, and Matthew, noting Anne’s paleness and indifference and the
      lagging steps that bore her home from the post office every afternoon, began
      seriously to wonder if he hadn’t better vote Grit at the next election.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      But one evening the news came. Anne was sitting at her open window, for the
      time forgetful of the woes of examinations and the cares of the world, as she
      drank in the beauty of the summer dusk, sweet-scented with flower breaths from
      the garden below and sibilant and rustling from the stir of poplars. The
      eastern sky above the firs was flushed faintly pink from the reflection of the
      west, and Anne was wondering dreamily if the spirit of color looked like that,
      when she saw Diana come flying down through the firs, over the log bridge, and
      up the slope, with a fluttering newspaper in her hand.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Anne sprang to her feet, knowing at once what that paper contained. The pass
      list was out! Her head whirled and her heart beat until it hurt her. She could
      not move a step. It seemed an hour to her before Diana came rushing along the
      hall and burst into the room without even knocking, so great was her
      excitement.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Anne, you’ve passed,” she cried, “passed the <i>very
        first</i>—you and Gilbert both—you’re ties—but your
      name is first. Oh, I’m so proud!”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Diana flung the paper on the table and herself on Anne’s bed, utterly
      breathless and incapable of further speech. Anne lighted the lamp, oversetting
      the match safe and using up half a dozen matches before her shaking hands could
      accomplish the task. Then she snatched up the paper. Yes, she had
      passed—there was her name at the very top of a list of two hundred! That
      moment was worth living for.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “You did just splendidly, Anne,” puffed Diana, recovering
      sufficiently to sit up and speak, for Anne, starry eyed and rapt, had not
      uttered a word. “Father brought the paper home from Bright River not ten
      minutes ago—it came out on the afternoon train, you know, and won’t
      be here till tomorrow by mail—and when I saw the pass list I just rushed
      over like a wild thing. You’ve all passed, every one of you, Moody
      Spurgeon and all, although he’s conditioned in history. Jane and Ruby did
      pretty well—they’re halfway up—and so did Charlie. Josie just
      scraped through with three marks to spare, but you’ll see she’ll
      put on as many airs as if she’d led. Won’t Miss Stacy be delighted?
      Oh, Anne, what does it feel like to see your name at the head of a pass list
      like that? If it were me I know I’d go crazy with joy. I am pretty near
      crazy as it is, but you’re as calm and cool as a spring evening.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I’m just dazzled inside,” said Anne. “I want to say a
      hundred things, and I can’t find words to say them in. I never dreamed of
      this—yes, I did too, just once! I let myself think <i>once</i>,
      ‘What if I should come out first?’ quakingly, you know, for it
      seemed so vain and presumptuous to think I could lead the Island. Excuse me a
      minute, Diana. I must run right out to the field to tell Matthew. Then
      we’ll go up the road and tell the good news to the others.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      They hurried to the hayfield below the barn where Matthew was coiling hay, and,
      as luck would have it, Mrs. Lynde was talking to Marilla at the lane fence.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Oh, Matthew,” exclaimed Anne, “I’ve passed and
      I’m first—or one of the first! I’m not vain, but I’m
      thankful.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Well now, I always said it,” said Matthew, gazing at the pass list
      delightedly. “I knew you could beat them all easy.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “You’ve done pretty well, I must say, Anne,” said Marilla,
      trying to hide her extreme pride in Anne from Mrs. Rachel’s critical eye.
      But that good soul said heartily:
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I just guess she has done well, and far be it from me to be backward in
      saying it. You’re a credit to your friends, Anne, that’s what, and
      we’re all proud of you.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      That night Anne, who had wound up the delightful evening with a serious little
      talk with Mrs. Allan at the manse, knelt sweetly by her open window in a great
      sheen of moonshine and murmured a prayer of gratitude and aspiration that came
      straight from her heart. There was in it thankfulness for the past and reverent
      petition for the future; and when she slept on her white pillow her dreams were
      as fair and bright and beautiful as maidenhood might desire.

    <h2><a id="link2HCH0033"></a>
      CHAPTER XXXIII.<br>
      The Hotel Concert</h2>
    
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">P</span>UT on your white
      organdy, by all means, Anne,” advised Diana decidedly.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      They were together in the east gable chamber; outside it was only
      twilight—a lovely yellowish-green twilight with a clear-blue cloudless
      sky. A big round moon, slowly deepening from her pallid luster into burnished
      silver, hung over the Haunted Wood; the air was full of sweet summer
      sounds—sleepy birds twittering, freakish breezes, faraway voices and
      laughter. But in Anne’s room the blind was drawn and the lamp lighted,
      for an important toilet was being made.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The east gable was a very different place from what it had been on that night
      four years before, when Anne had felt its bareness penetrate to the marrow of
      her spirit with its inhospitable chill. Changes had crept in, Marilla conniving
      at them resignedly, until it was as sweet and dainty a nest as a young girl
      could desire.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The velvet carpet with the pink roses and the pink silk curtains of
      Anne’s early visions had certainly never materialized; but her dreams had
      kept pace with her growth, and it is not probable she lamented them. The floor
      was covered with a pretty matting, and the curtains that softened the high
      window and fluttered in the vagrant breezes were of pale-green art muslin. The
      walls, hung not with gold and silver brocade tapestry, but with a dainty
      apple-blossom paper, were adorned with a few good pictures given Anne by Mrs.
      Allan. Miss Stacy’s photograph occupied the place of honor, and Anne made
      a sentimental point of keeping fresh flowers on the bracket under it. Tonight a
      spike of white lilies faintly perfumed the room like the dream of a fragrance.
      There was no “mahogany furniture,” but there was a white-painted
      bookcase filled with books, a cushioned wicker rocker, a toilet table befrilled
      with white muslin, a quaint, gilt-framed mirror with chubby pink Cupids and
      purple grapes painted over its arched top, that used to hang in the spare room,
      and a low white bed.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Anne was dressing for a concert at the White Sands Hotel. The guests had got it
      up in aid of the Charlottetown hospital, and had hunted out all the available
      amateur talent in the surrounding districts to help it along. Bertha Sampson
      and Pearl Clay of the White Sands Baptist choir had been asked to sing a duet;
      Milton Clark of Newbridge was to give a violin solo; Winnie Adella Blair of
      Carmody was to sing a Scotch ballad; and Laura Spencer of Spencervale and Anne
      Shirley of Avonlea were to recite.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      As Anne would have said at one time, it was “an epoch in her life,”
      and she was deliciously athrill with the excitement of it. Matthew was in the
      seventh heaven of gratified pride over the honor conferred on his Anne and
      Marilla was not far behind, although she would have died rather than admit it,
      and said she didn’t think it was very proper for a lot of young folks to
      be gadding over to the hotel without any responsible person with them.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Anne and Diana were to drive over with Jane Andrews and her brother Billy in
      their double-seated buggy; and several other Avonlea girls and boys were going
      too. There was a party of visitors expected out from town, and after the
      concert a supper was to be given to the performers.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Do you really think the organdy will be best?” queried Anne
      anxiously. “I don’t think it’s as pretty as my blue-flowered
      muslin—and it certainly isn’t so fashionable.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “But it suits you ever so much better,” said Diana.
      “It’s so soft and frilly and clinging. The muslin is stiff, and
      makes you look too dressed up. But the organdy seems as if it grew on
      you.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Anne sighed and yielded. Diana was beginning to have a reputation for notable
      taste in dressing, and her advice on such subjects was much sought after. She
      was looking very pretty herself on this particular night in a dress of the
      lovely wild-rose pink, from which Anne was forever debarred; but she was not to
      take any part in the concert, so her appearance was of minor importance. All
      her pains were bestowed upon Anne, who, she vowed, must, for the credit of
      Avonlea, be dressed and combed and adorned to the Queen’s taste.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Pull out that frill a little more—so; here, let me tie your sash;
      now for your slippers. I’m going to braid your hair in two thick braids,
      and tie them halfway up with big white bows—no, don’t pull out a
      single curl over your forehead—just have the soft part. There is no way
      you do your hair suits you so well, Anne, and Mrs. Allan says you look like a
      Madonna when you part it so. I shall fasten this little white house rose just
      behind your ear. There was just one on my bush, and I saved it for you.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Shall I put my pearl beads on?” asked Anne. “Matthew brought
      me a string from town last week, and I know he’d like to see them on
      me.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Diana pursed up her lips, put her black head on one side critically, and
      finally pronounced in favor of the beads, which were thereupon tied around
      Anne’s slim milk-white throat.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “There’s something so stylish about you, Anne,” said Diana,
      with unenvious admiration. “You hold your head with such an air. I
      suppose it’s your figure. I am just a dumpling. I’ve always been
      afraid of it, and now I know it is so. Well, I suppose I shall just have to
      resign myself to it.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “But you have such dimples,” said Anne, smiling affectionately into
      the pretty, vivacious face so near her own. “Lovely dimples, like little
      dents in cream. I have given up all hope of dimples. My dimple-dream will never
      come true; but so many of my dreams have that I mustn’t complain. Am I
      all ready now?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “All ready,” assured Diana, as Marilla appeared in the doorway, a
      gaunt figure with grayer hair than of yore and no fewer angles, but with a much
      softer face. “Come right in and look at our elocutionist, Marilla.
      Doesn’t she look lovely?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Marilla emitted a sound between a sniff and a grunt.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “She looks neat and proper. I like that way of fixing her hair. But I
      expect she’ll ruin that dress driving over there in the dust and dew with
      it, and it looks most too thin for these damp nights. Organdy’s the most
      unserviceable stuff in the world anyhow, and I told Matthew so when he got it.
      But there is no use in saying anything to Matthew nowadays. Time was when he
      would take my advice, but now he just buys things for Anne regardless, and the
      clerks at Carmody know they can palm anything off on him. Just let them tell
      him a thing is pretty and fashionable, and Matthew plunks his money down for
      it. Mind you keep your skirt clear of the wheel, Anne, and put your warm jacket
      on.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Then Marilla stalked downstairs, thinking proudly how sweet Anne looked, with
      that
    </p>
    
    <p class="poem">
      “One moonbeam from the forehead to the crown”
    </p>
    
    <p class="noindent">
      and regretting that she could not go to the concert herself to hear her girl
      recite.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I wonder if it <i>is</i> too damp for my dress,” said Anne
      anxiously.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Not a bit of it,” said Diana, pulling up the window blind.
      “It’s a perfect night, and there won’t be any dew. Look at
      the moonlight.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I’m so glad my window looks east into the sun rising,” said
      Anne, going over to Diana. “It’s so splendid to see the morning
      coming up over those long hills and glowing through those sharp fir tops.
      It’s new every morning, and I feel as if I washed my very soul in that
      bath of earliest sunshine. Oh, Diana, I love this little room so dearly. I
      don’t know how I’ll get along without it when I go to town next
      month.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Don’t speak of your going away tonight,” begged Diana.
      “I don’t want to think of it, it makes me so miserable, and I do
      want to have a good time this evening. What are you going to recite, Anne? And
      are you nervous?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Not a bit. I’ve recited so often in public I don’t mind at
      all now. I’ve decided to give ‘The Maiden’s Vow.’
      It’s so pathetic. Laura Spencer is going to give a comic recitation, but
      I’d rather make people cry than laugh.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “What will you recite if they encore you?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “They won’t dream of encoring me,” scoffed Anne, who was not
      without her own secret hopes that they would, and already visioned herself
      telling Matthew all about it at the next morning’s breakfast table.
      “There are Billy and Jane now—I hear the wheels. Come on.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Billy Andrews insisted that Anne should ride on the front seat with him, so she
      unwillingly climbed up. She would have much preferred to sit back with the
      girls, where she could have laughed and chattered to her heart’s content.
      There was not much of either laughter or chatter in Billy. He was a big, fat,
      stolid youth of twenty, with a round, expressionless face, and a painful lack
      of conversational gifts. But he admired Anne immensely, and was puffed up with
      pride over the prospect of driving to White Sands with that slim, upright
      figure beside him.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Anne, by dint of talking over her shoulder to the girls and occasionally
      passing a sop of civility to Billy—who grinned and chuckled and never
      could think of any reply until it was too late—contrived to enjoy the
      drive in spite of all. It was a night for enjoyment. The road was full of
      buggies, all bound for the hotel, and laughter, silver clear, echoed and
      reechoed along it. When they reached the hotel it was a blaze of light from top
      to bottom. They were met by the ladies of the concert committee, one of whom
      took Anne off to the performers’ dressing room which was filled with the
      members of a Charlottetown Symphony Club, among whom Anne felt suddenly shy and
      frightened and countrified. Her dress, which, in the east gable, had seemed so
      dainty and pretty, now seemed simple and plain—too simple and plain, she
      thought, among all the silks and laces that glistened and rustled around her.
      What were her pearl beads compared to the diamonds of the big, handsome lady
      near her? And how poor her one wee white rose must look beside all the hothouse
      flowers the others wore! Anne laid her hat and jacket away, and shrank
      miserably into a corner. She wished herself back in the white room at Green
      Gables.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      It was still worse on the platform of the big concert hall of the hotel, where
      she presently found herself. The electric lights dazzled her eyes, the perfume
      and hum bewildered her. She wished she were sitting down in the audience with
      Diana and Jane, who seemed to be having a splendid time away at the back. She
      was wedged in between a stout lady in pink silk and a tall, scornful-looking
      girl in a white-lace dress. The stout lady occasionally turned her head
      squarely around and surveyed Anne through her eyeglasses until Anne, acutely
      sensitive of being so scrutinized, felt that she must scream aloud; and the
      white-lace girl kept talking audibly to her next neighbor about the
      “country bumpkins” and “rustic belles” in the audience,
      languidly anticipating “such fun” from the displays of local talent
      on the program. Anne believed that she would hate that white-lace girl to the
      end of life.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Unfortunately for Anne, a professional elocutionist was staying at the hotel
      and had consented to recite. She was a lithe, dark-eyed woman in a wonderful
      gown of shimmering gray stuff like woven moonbeams, with gems on her neck and
      in her dark hair. She had a marvelously flexible voice and wonderful power of
      expression; the audience went wild over her selection. Anne, forgetting all
      about herself and her troubles for the time, listened with rapt and shining
      eyes; but when the recitation ended she suddenly put her hands over her face.
      She could never get up and recite after that—never. Had she ever thought
      she could recite? Oh, if she were only back at Green Gables!
    </p>
    
    <p>
      At this unpropitious moment her name was called. Somehow Anne—who did not
      notice the rather guilty little start of surprise the white-lace girl gave, and
      would not have understood the subtle compliment implied therein if she
      had—got on her feet, and moved dizzily out to the front. She was so pale
      that Diana and Jane, down in the audience, clasped each other’s hands in
      nervous sympathy.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Anne was the victim of an overwhelming attack of stage fright. Often as she had
      recited in public, she had never before faced such an audience as this, and the
      sight of it paralyzed her energies completely. Everything was so strange, so
      brilliant, so bewildering—the rows of ladies in evening dress, the
      critical faces, the whole atmosphere of wealth and culture about her. Very
      different this from the plain benches at the Debating Club, filled with the
      homely, sympathetic faces of friends and neighbors. These people, she thought,
      would be merciless critics. Perhaps, like the white-lace girl, they anticipated
      amusement from her “rustic” efforts. She felt hopelessly,
      helplessly ashamed and miserable. Her knees trembled, her heart fluttered, a
      horrible faintness came over her; not a word could she utter, and the next
      moment she would have fled from the platform despite the humiliation which, she
      felt, must ever after be her portion if she did so.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      But suddenly, as her dilated, frightened eyes gazed out over the audience, she
      saw Gilbert Blythe away at the back of the room, bending forward with a smile
      on his face—a smile which seemed to Anne at once triumphant and taunting.
      In reality it was nothing of the kind. Gilbert was merely smiling with
      appreciation of the whole affair in general and of the effect produced by
      Anne’s slender white form and spiritual face against a background of
      palms in particular. Josie Pye, whom he had driven over, sat beside him, and
      her face certainly was both triumphant and taunting. But Anne did not see
      Josie, and would not have cared if she had. She drew a long breath and flung
      her head up proudly, courage and determination tingling over her like an
      electric shock. She <i>would not</i> fail before Gilbert Blythe—he should
      never be able to laugh at her, never, never! Her fright and nervousness
      vanished; and she began her recitation, her clear, sweet voice reaching to the
      farthest corner of the room without a tremor or a break. Self-possession was
      fully restored to her, and in the reaction from that horrible moment of
      powerlessness she recited as she had never done before. When she finished there
      were bursts of honest applause. Anne, stepping back to her seat, blushing with
      shyness and delight, found her hand vigorously clasped and shaken by the stout
      lady in pink silk.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “My dear, you did splendidly,” she puffed. “I’ve been
      crying like a baby, actually I have. There, they’re encoring
      you—they’re bound to have you back!”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Oh, I can’t go,” said Anne confusedly. “But
      yet—I must, or Matthew will be disappointed. He said they would encore
      me.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Then don’t disappoint Matthew,” said the pink lady,
      laughing.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Smiling, blushing, limpid eyed, Anne tripped back and gave a quaint, funny
      little selection that captivated her audience still further. The rest of the
      evening was quite a little triumph for her.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      When the concert was over, the stout, pink lady—who was the wife of an
      American millionaire—took her under her wing, and introduced her to
      everybody; and everybody was very nice to her. The professional elocutionist,
      Mrs. Evans, came and chatted with her, telling her that she had a charming
      voice and “interpreted” her selections beautifully. Even the
      white-lace girl paid her a languid little compliment. They had supper in the
      big, beautifully decorated dining room; Diana and Jane were invited to partake
      of this, also, since they had come with Anne, but Billy was nowhere to be
      found, having decamped in mortal fear of some such invitation. He was in
      waiting for them, with the team, however, when it was all over, and the three
      girls came merrily out into the calm, white moonshine radiance. Anne breathed
      deeply, and looked into the clear sky beyond the dark boughs of the firs.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Oh, it was good to be out again in the purity and silence of the night! How
      great and still and wonderful everything was, with the murmur of the sea
      sounding through it and the darkling cliffs beyond like grim giants guarding
      enchanted coasts.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Hasn’t it been a perfectly splendid time?” sighed Jane, as
      they drove away. “I just wish I was a rich American and could spend my
      summer at a hotel and wear jewels and low-necked dresses and have ice cream and
      chicken salad every blessed day. I’m sure it would be ever so much more
      fun than teaching school. Anne, your recitation was simply great, although I
      thought at first you were never going to begin. I think it was better than Mrs.
      Evans’s.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Oh, no, don’t say things like that, Jane,” said Anne
      quickly, “because it sounds silly. It couldn’t be better than Mrs.
      Evans’s, you know, for she is a professional, and I’m only a
      schoolgirl, with a little knack of reciting. I’m quite satisfied if the
      people just liked mine pretty well.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I’ve a compliment for you, Anne,” said Diana. “At
      least I think it must be a compliment because of the tone he said it in. Part
      of it was anyhow. There was an American sitting behind Jane and me—such a
      romantic-looking man, with coal-black hair and eyes. Josie Pye says he is a
      distinguished artist, and that her mother’s cousin in Boston is married
      to a man that used to go to school with him. Well, we heard him
      say—didn’t we, Jane?—‘Who is that girl on the platform
      with the splendid Titian hair? She has a face I should like to paint.’
      There now, Anne. But what does Titian hair mean?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Being interpreted it means plain red, I guess,” laughed Anne.
      “Titian was a very famous artist who liked to paint red-haired
      women.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “<i>Did</i> you see all the diamonds those ladies wore?” sighed
      Jane. “They were simply dazzling. Wouldn’t you just love to be
      rich, girls?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “We <i>are</i> rich,” said Anne staunchly. “Why, we have
      sixteen years to our credit, and we’re happy as queens, and we’ve
      all got imaginations, more or less. Look at that sea, girls—all silver
      and shadow and vision of things not seen. We couldn’t enjoy its
      loveliness any more if we had millions of dollars and ropes of diamonds. You
      wouldn’t change into any of those women if you could. Would you want to
      be that white-lace girl and wear a sour look all your life, as if you’d
      been born turning up your nose at the world? Or the pink lady, kind and nice as
      she is, so stout and short that you’d really no figure at all? Or even
      Mrs. Evans, with that sad, sad look in her eyes? She must have been dreadfully
      unhappy sometime to have such a look. You <i>know</i> you wouldn’t, Jane
      Andrews!”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I <i>don’t</i> know—exactly,” said Jane unconvinced.
      “I think diamonds would comfort a person for a good deal.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Well, I don’t want to be anyone but myself, even if I go
      uncomforted by diamonds all my life,” declared Anne. “I’m
      quite content to be Anne of Green Gables, with my string of pearl beads. I know
      Matthew gave me as much love with them as ever went with Madame the Pink
      Lady’s jewels.”

      CHAPTER XXXIV.<br>
      A Queen’s Girl</h2>
    
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE next three weeks
      were busy ones at Green Gables, for Anne was getting ready to go to
      Queen’s, and there was much sewing to be done, and many things to be
      talked over and arranged. Anne’s outfit was ample and pretty, for Matthew
      saw to that, and Marilla for once made no objections whatever to anything he
      purchased or suggested. More—one evening she went up to the east gable
      with her arms full of a delicate pale green material.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Anne, here’s something for a nice light dress for you. I
      don’t suppose you really need it; you’ve plenty of pretty waists;
      but I thought maybe you’d like something real dressy to wear if you were
      asked out anywhere of an evening in town, to a party or anything like that. I
      hear that Jane and Ruby and Josie have got ‘evening dresses,’ as
      they call them, and I don’t mean you shall be behind them. I got Mrs.
      Allan to help me pick it in town last week, and we’ll get Emily Gillis to
      make it for you. Emily has got taste, and her fits aren’t to be
      equaled.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Oh, Marilla, it’s just lovely,” said Anne. “Thank you
      so much. I don’t believe you ought to be so kind to me—it’s
      making it harder every day for me to go away.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The green dress was made up with as many tucks and frills and shirrings as
      Emily’s taste permitted. Anne put it on one evening for Matthew’s
      and Marilla’s benefit, and recited “The Maiden’s Vow”
      for them in the kitchen. As Marilla watched the bright, animated face and
      graceful motions her thoughts went back to the evening Anne had arrived at
      Green Gables, and memory recalled a vivid picture of the odd, frightened child
      in her preposterous yellowish-brown wincey dress, the heartbreak looking out of
      her tearful eyes. Something in the memory brought tears to Marilla’s own
      eyes.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I declare, my recitation has made you cry, Marilla,” said Anne
      gaily stooping over Marilla’s chair to drop a butterfly kiss on that
      lady’s cheek. “Now, I call that a positive triumph.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “No, I wasn’t crying over your piece,” said Marilla, who
      would have scorned to be betrayed into such weakness by any poetry stuff.
      “I just couldn’t help thinking of the little girl you used to be,
      Anne. And I was wishing you could have stayed a little girl, even with all your
      queer ways. You’ve grown up now and you’re going away; and you look
      so tall and stylish and so—so—different altogether in that
      dress—as if you didn’t belong in Avonlea at all—and I just
      got lonesome thinking it all over.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Marilla!” Anne sat down on Marilla’s gingham lap, took
      Marilla’s lined face between her hands, and looked gravely and tenderly
      into Marilla’s eyes. “I’m not a bit changed—not really.
      I’m only just pruned down and branched out. The real <i>me</i>—back
      here—is just the same. It won’t make a bit of difference where I go
      or how much I change outwardly; at heart I shall always be your little Anne,
      who will love you and Matthew and dear Green Gables more and better every day
      of her life.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Anne laid her fresh young cheek against Marilla’s faded one, and reached
      out a hand to pat Matthew’s shoulder. Marilla would have given much just
      then to have possessed Anne’s power of putting her feelings into words;
      but nature and habit had willed it otherwise, and she could only put her arms
      close about her girl and hold her tenderly to her heart, wishing that she need
      never let her go.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Matthew, with a suspicious moisture in his eyes, got up and went out-of-doors.
      Under the stars of the blue summer night he walked agitatedly across the yard
      to the gate under the poplars.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Well now, I guess she ain’t been much spoiled,” he muttered,
      proudly. “I guess my putting in my oar occasional never did much harm
      after all. She’s smart and pretty, and loving, too, which is better than
      all the rest. She’s been a blessing to us, and there never was a luckier
      mistake than what Mrs. Spencer made—if it <i>was</i> luck. I don’t
      believe it was any such thing. It was Providence, because the Almighty saw we
      needed her, I reckon.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The day finally came when Anne must go to town. She and Matthew drove in one
      fine September morning, after a tearful parting with Diana and an untearful
      practical one—on Marilla’s side at least—with Marilla. But
      when Anne had gone Diana dried her tears and went to a beach picnic at White
      Sands with some of her Carmody cousins, where she contrived to enjoy herself
      tolerably well; while Marilla plunged fiercely into unnecessary work and kept
      at it all day long with the bitterest kind of heartache—the ache that
      burns and gnaws and cannot wash itself away in ready tears. But that night,
      when Marilla went to bed, acutely and miserably conscious that the little gable
      room at the end of the hall was untenanted by any vivid young life and
      unstirred by any soft breathing, she buried her face in her pillow, and wept
      for her girl in a passion of sobs that appalled her when she grew calm enough
      to reflect how very wicked it must be to take on so about a sinful fellow
      creature.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Anne and the rest of the Avonlea scholars reached town just in time to hurry
      off to the Academy. That first day passed pleasantly enough in a whirl of
      excitement, meeting all the new students, learning to know the professors by
      sight and being assorted and organized into classes. Anne intended taking up
      the Second Year work being advised to do so by Miss Stacy; Gilbert Blythe
      elected to do the same. This meant getting a First Class teacher’s
      license in one year instead of two, if they were successful; but it also meant
      much more and harder work. Jane, Ruby, Josie, Charlie, and Moody Spurgeon, not
      being troubled with the stirrings of ambition, were content to take up the
      Second Class work. Anne was conscious of a pang of loneliness when she found
      herself in a room with fifty other students, not one of whom she knew, except
      the tall, brown-haired boy across the room; and knowing him in the fashion she
      did, did not help her much, as she reflected pessimistically. Yet she was
      undeniably glad that they were in the same class; the old rivalry could still
      be carried on, and Anne would hardly have known what to do if it had been
      lacking.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I wouldn’t feel comfortable without it,” she thought.
      “Gilbert looks awfully determined. I suppose he’s making up his
      mind, here and now, to win the medal. What a splendid chin he has! I never
      noticed it before. I do wish Jane and Ruby had gone in for First Class, too. I
      suppose I won’t feel so much like a cat in a strange garret when I get
      acquainted, though. I wonder which of the girls here are going to be my
      friends. It’s really an interesting speculation. Of course I promised
      Diana that no Queen’s girl, no matter how much I liked her, should ever
      be as dear to me as she is; but I’ve lots of second-best affections to
      bestow. I like the look of that girl with the brown eyes and the crimson waist.
      She looks vivid and red-rosy; there’s that pale, fair one gazing out of
      the window. She has lovely hair, and looks as if she knew a thing or two about
      dreams. I’d like to know them both—know them well—well enough
      to walk with my arm about their waists, and call them nicknames. But just now I
      don’t know them and they don’t know me, and probably don’t
      want to know me particularly. Oh, it’s lonesome!”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      It was lonesomer still when Anne found herself alone in her hall bedroom that
      night at twilight. She was not to board with the other girls, who all had
      relatives in town to take pity on them. Miss Josephine Barry would have liked
      to board her, but Beechwood was so far from the Academy that it was out of the
      question; so Miss Barry hunted up a boarding-house, assuring Matthew and
      Marilla that it was the very place for Anne.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “The lady who keeps it is a reduced gentlewoman,” explained Miss
      Barry. “Her husband was a British officer, and she is very careful what
      sort of boarders she takes. Anne will not meet with any objectionable persons
      under her roof. The table is good, and the house is near the Academy, in a
      quiet neighborhood.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      All this might be quite true, and indeed, proved to be so, but it did not
      materially help Anne in the first agony of homesickness that seized upon her.
      She looked dismally about her narrow little room, with its dull-papered,
      pictureless walls, its small iron bedstead and empty bookcase; and a horrible
      choke came into her throat as she thought of her own white room at Green
      Gables, where she would have the pleasant consciousness of a great green still
      outdoors, of sweet peas growing in the garden, and moonlight falling on the
      orchard, of the brook below the slope and the spruce boughs tossing in the
      night wind beyond it, of a vast starry sky, and the light from Diana’s
      window shining out through the gap in the trees. Here there was nothing of
      this; Anne knew that outside of her window was a hard street, with a network of
      telephone wires shutting out the sky, the tramp of alien feet, and a thousand
      lights gleaming on stranger faces. She knew that she was going to cry, and
      fought against it.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I <i>won’t</i> cry. It’s silly—and
      weak—there’s the third tear splashing down by my nose. There are
      more coming! I must think of something funny to stop them. But there’s
      nothing funny except what is connected with Avonlea, and that only makes things
      worse—four—five—I’m going home next Friday, but that
      seems a hundred years away. Oh, Matthew is nearly home by now—and Marilla
      is at the gate, looking down the lane for
      him—six—seven—eight—oh, there’s no use in
      counting them! They’re coming in a flood presently. I can’t cheer
      up—I don’t <i>want</i> to cheer up. It’s nicer to be
      miserable!”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The flood of tears would have come, no doubt, had not Josie Pye appeared at
      that moment. In the joy of seeing a familiar face Anne forgot that there had
      never been much love lost between her and Josie. As a part of Avonlea life even
      a Pye was welcome.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I’m so glad you came up,” Anne said sincerely.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “You’ve been crying,” remarked Josie, with aggravating pity.
      “I suppose you’re homesick—some people have so little
      self-control in that respect. I’ve no intention of being homesick, I can
      tell you. Town’s too jolly after that poky old Avonlea. I wonder how I
      ever existed there so long. You shouldn’t cry, Anne; it isn’t
      becoming, for your nose and eyes get red, and then you seem <i>all</i> red.
      I’d a perfectly scrumptious time in the Academy today. Our French
      professor is simply a duck. His moustache would give you kerwollowps of the
      heart. Have you anything eatable around, Anne? I’m literally starving.
      Ah, I guessed likely Marilla ‘d load you up with cake. That’s why I
      called round. Otherwise I’d have gone to the park to hear the band play
      with Frank Stockley. He boards same place as I do, and he’s a sport. He
      noticed you in class today, and asked me who the red-headed girl was. I told
      him you were an orphan that the Cuthberts had adopted, and nobody knew very
      much about what you’d been before that.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Anne was wondering if, after all, solitude and tears were not more satisfactory
      than Josie Pye’s companionship when Jane and Ruby appeared, each with an
      inch of Queen’s color ribbon—purple and scarlet—pinned
      proudly to her coat. As Josie was not “speaking” to Jane just then
      she had to subside into comparative harmlessness.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Well,” said Jane with a sigh, “I feel as if I’d lived
      many moons since the morning. I ought to be home studying my Virgil—that
      horrid old professor gave us twenty lines to start in on tomorrow. But I simply
      couldn’t settle down to study tonight. Anne, methinks I see the traces of
      tears. If you’ve been crying <i>do</i> own up. It will restore my
      self-respect, for I was shedding tears freely before Ruby came along. I
      don’t mind being a goose so much if somebody else is goosey, too. Cake?
      You’ll give me a teeny piece, won’t you? Thank you. It has the real
      Avonlea flavor.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Ruby, perceiving the Queen’s calendar lying on the table, wanted to know
      if Anne meant to try for the gold medal.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Anne blushed and admitted she was thinking of it.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Oh, that reminds me,” said Josie, “Queen’s is to get
      one of the Avery scholarships after all. The word came today. Frank Stockley
      told me—his uncle is one of the board of governors, you know. It will be
      announced in the Academy tomorrow.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      An Avery scholarship! Anne felt her heart beat more quickly, and the horizons
      of her ambition shifted and broadened as if by magic. Before Josie had told the
      news Anne’s highest pinnacle of aspiration had been a teacher’s
      provincial license, First Class, at the end of the year, and perhaps the medal!
      But now in one moment Anne saw herself winning the Avery scholarship, taking an
      Arts course at Redmond College, and graduating in a gown and mortar board,
      before the echo of Josie’s words had died away. For the Avery scholarship
      was in English, and Anne felt that here her foot was on native heath.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      A wealthy manufacturer of New Brunswick had died and left part of his fortune
      to endow a large number of scholarships to be distributed among the various
      high schools and academies of the Maritime Provinces, according to their
      respective standings. There had been much doubt whether one would be allotted
      to Queen’s, but the matter was settled at last, and at the end of the
      year the graduate who made the highest mark in English and English Literature
      would win the scholarship—two hundred and fifty dollars a year for four
      years at Redmond College. No wonder that Anne went to bed that night with
      tingling cheeks!
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I’ll win that scholarship if hard work can do it,” she
      resolved. “Wouldn’t Matthew be proud if I got to be a B.A.? Oh,
      it’s delightful to have ambitions. I’m so glad I have such a lot.
      And there never seems to be any end to them—that’s the best of it.
      Just as soon as you attain to one ambition you see another one glittering
      higher up still. It does make life so interesting.”

      The Winter at Queen’s</h2>
    
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>NNE’S
      homesickness wore off, greatly helped in the wearing by her weekend visits
      home. As long as the open weather lasted the Avonlea students went out to
      Carmody on the new branch railway every Friday night. Diana and several other
      Avonlea young folks were generally on hand to meet them and they all walked
      over to Avonlea in a merry party. Anne thought those Friday evening gypsyings
      over the autumnal hills in the crisp golden air, with the homelights of Avonlea
      twinkling beyond, were the best and dearest hours in the whole week.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Gilbert Blythe nearly always walked with Ruby Gillis and carried her satchel
      for her. Ruby was a very handsome young lady, now thinking herself quite as
      grown up as she really was; she wore her skirts as long as her mother would let
      her and did her hair up in town, though she had to take it down when she went
      home. She had large, bright-blue eyes, a brilliant complexion, and a plump
      showy figure. She laughed a great deal, was cheerful and good-tempered, and
      enjoyed the pleasant things of life frankly.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “But I shouldn’t think she was the sort of girl Gilbert would
      like,” whispered Jane to Anne. Anne did not think so either, but she
      would not have said so for the Avery scholarship. She could not help thinking,
      too, that it would be very pleasant to have such a friend as Gilbert to jest
      and chatter with and exchange ideas about books and studies and ambitions.
      Gilbert had ambitions, she knew, and Ruby Gillis did not seem the sort of
      person with whom such could be profitably discussed.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      There was no silly sentiment in Anne’s ideas concerning Gilbert. Boys
      were to her, when she thought about them at all, merely possible good comrades.
      If she and Gilbert had been friends she would not have cared how many other
      friends he had nor with whom he walked. She had a genius for friendship; girl
      friends she had in plenty; but she had a vague consciousness that masculine
      friendship might also be a good thing to round out one’s conceptions of
      companionship and furnish broader standpoints of judgment and comparison. Not
      that Anne could have put her feelings on the matter into just such clear
      definition. But she thought that if Gilbert had ever walked home with her from
      the train, over the crisp fields and along the ferny byways, they might have
      had many and merry and interesting conversations about the new world that was
      opening around them and their hopes and ambitions therein. Gilbert was a clever
      young fellow, with his own thoughts about things and a determination to get the
      best out of life and put the best into it. Ruby Gillis told Jane Andrews that
      she didn’t understand half the things Gilbert Blythe said; he talked just
      like Anne Shirley did when she had a thoughtful fit on and for her part she
      didn’t think it any fun to be bothering about books and that sort of
      thing when you didn’t have to. Frank Stockley had lots more dash and go,
      but then he wasn’t half as good-looking as Gilbert and she really
      couldn’t decide which she liked best!
    </p>
    
    <p>
      In the Academy Anne gradually drew a little circle of friends about her,
      thoughtful, imaginative, ambitious students like herself. With the
      “rose-red” girl, Stella Maynard, and the “dream girl,”
      Priscilla Grant, she soon became intimate, finding the latter pale
      spiritual-looking maiden to be full to the brim of mischief and pranks and fun,
      while the vivid, black-eyed Stella had a heartful of wistful dreams and
      fancies, as aerial and rainbow-like as Anne’s own.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      After the Christmas holidays the Avonlea students gave up going home on Fridays
      and settled down to hard work. By this time all the Queen’s scholars had
      gravitated into their own places in the ranks and the various classes had
      assumed distinct and settled shadings of individuality. Certain facts had
      become generally accepted. It was admitted that the medal contestants had
      practically narrowed down to three—Gilbert Blythe, Anne Shirley, and
      Lewis Wilson; the Avery scholarship was more doubtful, any one of a certain six
      being a possible winner. The bronze medal for mathematics was considered as
      good as won by a fat, funny little up-country boy with a bumpy forehead and a
      patched coat.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Ruby Gillis was the handsomest girl of the year at the Academy; in the Second
      Year classes Stella Maynard carried off the palm for beauty, with small but
      critical minority in favor of Anne Shirley. Ethel Marr was admitted by all
      competent judges to have the most stylish modes of hair-dressing, and Jane
      Andrews—plain, plodding, conscientious Jane—carried off the honors
      in the domestic science course. Even Josie Pye attained a certain preeminence
      as the sharpest-tongued young lady in attendance at Queen’s. So it may be
      fairly stated that Miss Stacy’s old pupils held their own in the wider
      arena of the academical course.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Anne worked hard and steadily. Her rivalry with Gilbert was as intense as it
      had ever been in Avonlea school, although it was not known in the class at
      large, but somehow the bitterness had gone out of it. Anne no longer wished to
      win for the sake of defeating Gilbert; rather, for the proud consciousness of a
      well-won victory over a worthy foeman. It would be worth while to win, but she
      no longer thought life would be insupportable if she did not.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      In spite of lessons the students found opportunities for pleasant times. Anne
      spent many of her spare hours at Beechwood and generally ate her Sunday dinners
      there and went to church with Miss Barry. The latter was, as she admitted,
      growing old, but her black eyes were not dim nor the vigor of her tongue in the
      least abated. But she never sharpened the latter on Anne, who continued to be a
      prime favorite with the critical old lady.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “That Anne-girl improves all the time,” she said. “I get
      tired of other girls—there is such a provoking and eternal sameness about
      them. Anne has as many shades as a rainbow and every shade is the prettiest
      while it lasts. I don’t know that she is as amusing as she was when she
      was a child, but she makes me love her and I like people who make me love them.
      It saves me so much trouble in making myself love them.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Then, almost before anybody realized it, spring had come; out in Avonlea the
      Mayflowers were peeping pinkly out on the sere barrens where snow-wreaths
      lingered; and the “mist of green” was on the woods and in the
      valleys. But in Charlottetown harassed Queen’s students thought and
      talked only of examinations.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “It doesn’t seem possible that the term is nearly over,” said
      Anne. “Why, last fall it seemed so long to look forward to—a whole
      winter of studies and classes. And here we are, with the exams looming up next
      week. Girls, sometimes I feel as if those exams meant everything, but when I
      look at the big buds swelling on those chestnut trees and the misty blue air at
      the end of the streets they don’t seem half so important.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Jane and Ruby and Josie, who had dropped in, did not take this view of it. To
      them the coming examinations were constantly very important indeed—far
      more important than chestnut buds or Maytime hazes. It was all very well for
      Anne, who was sure of passing at least, to have her moments of belittling them,
      but when your whole future depended on them—as the girls truly thought
      theirs did—you could not regard them philosophically.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I’ve lost seven pounds in the last two weeks,” sighed Jane.
      “It’s no use to say don’t worry. I <i>will</i> worry.
      Worrying helps you some—it seems as if you were doing something when
      you’re worrying. It would be dreadful if I failed to get my license after
      going to Queen’s all winter and spending so much money.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “<i>I</i> don’t care,” said Josie Pye. “If I
      don’t pass this year I’m coming back next. My father can afford to
      send me. Anne, Frank Stockley says that Professor Tremaine said Gilbert Blythe
      was sure to get the medal and that Emily Clay would likely win the Avery
      scholarship.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “That may make me feel badly tomorrow, Josie,” laughed Anne,
      “but just now I honestly feel that as long as I know the violets are
      coming out all purple down in the hollow below Green Gables and that little
      ferns are poking their heads up in Lovers’ Lane, it’s not a great
      deal of difference whether I win the Avery or not. I’ve done my best and
      I begin to understand what is meant by the ‘joy of the strife.’
      Next to trying and winning, the best thing is trying and failing. Girls,
      don’t talk about exams! Look at that arch of pale green sky over those
      houses and picture to yourself what it must look like over the purply-dark
      beech-woods back of Avonlea.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “What are you going to wear for commencement, Jane?” asked Ruby
      practically.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Jane and Josie both answered at once and the chatter drifted into a side eddy
      of fashions. But Anne, with her elbows on the window sill, her soft cheek laid
      against her clasped hands, and her eyes filled with visions, looked out
      unheedingly across city roof and spire to that glorious dome of sunset sky and
      wove her dreams of a possible future from the golden tissue of youth’s
      own optimism. All the Beyond was hers with its possibilities lurking rosily in
      the oncoming years—each year a rose of promise to be woven into an
      immortal chaplet.

      CHAPTER XXXVI.<br>
      The Glory and the Dream</h2>
    
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>N the morning when the
      final results of all the examinations were to be posted on the bulletin board
      at Queen’s, Anne and Jane walked down the street together. Jane was
      smiling and happy; examinations were over and she was comfortably sure she had
      made a pass at least; further considerations troubled Jane not at all; she had
      no soaring ambitions and consequently was not affected with the unrest
      attendant thereon. For we pay a price for everything we get or take in this
      world; and although ambitions are well worth having, they are not to be cheaply
      won, but exact their dues of work and self-denial, anxiety and discouragement.
      Anne was pale and quiet; in ten more minutes she would know who had won the
      medal and who the Avery. Beyond those ten minutes there did not seem, just
      then, to be anything worth being called Time.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Of course you’ll win one of them anyhow,” said Jane, who
      couldn’t understand how the faculty could be so unfair as to order it
      otherwise.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I have not hope of the Avery,” said Anne. “Everybody says
      Emily Clay will win it. And I’m not going to march up to that bulletin
      board and look at it before everybody. I haven’t the moral courage.
      I’m going straight to the girls’ dressing room. You must read the
      announcements and then come and tell me, Jane. And I implore you in the name of
      our old friendship to do it as quickly as possible. If I have failed just say
      so, without trying to break it gently; and whatever you do <i>don’t</i>
      sympathize with me. Promise me this, Jane.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Jane promised solemnly; but, as it happened, there was no necessity for such a
      promise. When they went up the entrance steps of Queen’s they found the
      hall full of boys who were carrying Gilbert Blythe around on their shoulders
      and yelling at the tops of their voices, “Hurrah for Blythe,
      Medalist!”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      For a moment Anne felt one sickening pang of defeat and disappointment. So she
      had failed and Gilbert had won! Well, Matthew would be sorry—he had been
      so sure she would win.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      And then!
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Somebody called out:
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Three cheers for Miss Shirley, winner of the Avery!”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Oh, Anne,” gasped Jane, as they fled to the girls’ dressing
      room amid hearty cheers. “Oh, Anne I’m so proud! Isn’t it
      splendid?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      And then the girls were around them and Anne was the center of a laughing,
      congratulating group. Her shoulders were thumped and her hands shaken
      vigorously. She was pushed and pulled and hugged and among it all she managed
      to whisper to Jane:
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Oh, won’t Matthew and Marilla be pleased! I must write the news
      home right away.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Commencement was the next important happening. The exercises were held in the
      big assembly hall of the Academy. Addresses were given, essays read, songs
      sung, the public award of diplomas, prizes and medals made.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Matthew and Marilla were there, with eyes and ears for only one student on the
      platform—a tall girl in pale green, with faintly flushed cheeks and
      starry eyes, who read the best essay and was pointed out and whispered about as
      the Avery winner.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Reckon you’re glad we kept her, Marilla?” whispered Matthew,
      speaking for the first time since he had entered the hall, when Anne had
      finished her essay.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “It’s not the first time I’ve been glad,” retorted
      Marilla. “You do like to rub things in, Matthew Cuthbert.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Miss Barry, who was sitting behind them, leaned forward and poked Marilla in
      the back with her parasol.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Aren’t you proud of that Anne-girl? I am,” she said.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Anne went home to Avonlea with Matthew and Marilla that evening. She had not
      been home since April and she felt that she could not wait another day. The
      apple blossoms were out and the world was fresh and young. Diana was at Green
      Gables to meet her. In her own white room, where Marilla had set a flowering
      house rose on the window sill, Anne looked about her and drew a long breath of
      happiness.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Oh, Diana, it’s so good to be back again. It’s so good to
      see those pointed firs coming out against the pink sky—and that white
      orchard and the old Snow Queen. Isn’t the breath of the mint delicious?
      And that tea rose—why, it’s a song and a hope and a prayer all in
      one. And it’s <i>good</i> to see you again, Diana!”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I thought you liked that Stella Maynard better than me,” said
      Diana reproachfully. “Josie Pye told me you did. Josie said you were
      <i>infatuated</i> with her.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Anne laughed and pelted Diana with the faded “June lilies” of her
      bouquet.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Stella Maynard is the dearest girl in the world except one and you are
      that one, Diana,” she said. “I love you more than ever—and
      I’ve so many things to tell you. But just now I feel as if it were joy
      enough to sit here and look at you. I’m tired, I think—tired of
      being studious and ambitious. I mean to spend at least two hours tomorrow lying
      out in the orchard grass, thinking of absolutely nothing.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “You’ve done splendidly, Anne. I suppose you won’t be
      teaching now that you’ve won the Avery?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “No. I’m going to Redmond in September. Doesn’t it seem
      wonderful? I’ll have a brand new stock of ambition laid in by that time
      after three glorious, golden months of vacation. Jane and Ruby are going to
      teach. Isn’t it splendid to think we all got through even to Moody
      Spurgeon and Josie Pye?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “The Newbridge trustees have offered Jane their school already,”
      said Diana. “Gilbert Blythe is going to teach, too. He has to. His father
      can’t afford to send him to college next year, after all, so he means to
      earn his own way through. I expect he’ll get the school here if Miss Ames
      decides to leave.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Anne felt a queer little sensation of dismayed surprise. She had not known
      this; she had expected that Gilbert would be going to Redmond also. What would
      she do without their inspiring rivalry? Would not work, even at a coeducational
      college with a real degree in prospect, be rather flat without her friend the
      enemy?
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The next morning at breakfast it suddenly struck Anne that Matthew was not
      looking well. Surely he was much grayer than he had been a year before.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Marilla,” she said hesitatingly when he had gone out, “is
      Matthew quite well?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “No, he isn’t,” said Marilla in a troubled tone.
      “He’s had some real bad spells with his heart this spring and he
      won’t spare himself a mite. I’ve been real worried about him, but
      he’s some better this while back and we’ve got a good hired man, so
      I’m hoping he’ll kind of rest and pick up. Maybe he will now
      you’re home. You always cheer him up.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Anne leaned across the table and took Marilla’s face in her hands.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “You are not looking as well yourself as I’d like to see you,
      Marilla. You look tired. I’m afraid you’ve been working too hard.
      You must take a rest, now that I’m home. I’m just going to take
      this one day off to visit all the dear old spots and hunt up my old dreams, and
      then it will be your turn to be lazy while I do the work.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Marilla smiled affectionately at her girl.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “It’s not the work—it’s my head. I’ve got a pain
      so often now—behind my eyes. Doctor Spencer’s been fussing with
      glasses, but they don’t do me any good. There is a distinguished oculist
      coming to the Island the last of June and the doctor says I must see him. I
      guess I’ll have to. I can’t read or sew with any comfort now. Well,
      Anne, you’ve done real well at Queen’s I must say. To take First
      Class License in one year and win the Avery scholarship—well, well, Mrs.
      Lynde says pride goes before a fall and she doesn’t believe in the higher
      education of women at all; she says it unfits them for woman’s true
      sphere. I don’t believe a word of it. Speaking of Rachel reminds
      me—did you hear anything about the Abbey Bank lately, Anne?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I heard it was shaky,” answered Anne. “Why?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “That is what Rachel said. She was up here one day last week and said
      there was some talk about it. Matthew felt real worried. All we have saved is
      in that bank—every penny. I wanted Matthew to put it in the Savings Bank
      in the first place, but old Mr. Abbey was a great friend of father’s and
      he’d always banked with him. Matthew said any bank with him at the head
      of it was good enough for anybody.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I think he has only been its nominal head for many years,” said
      Anne. “He is a very old man; his nephews are really at the head of the
      institution.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Well, when Rachel told us that, I wanted Matthew to draw our money right
      out and he said he’d think of it. But Mr. Russell told him yesterday that
      the bank was all right.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Anne had her good day in the companionship of the outdoor world. She never
      forgot that day; it was so bright and golden and fair, so free from shadow and
      so lavish of blossom. Anne spent some of its rich hours in the orchard; she
      went to the Dryad’s Bubble and Willowmere and Violet Vale; she called at
      the manse and had a satisfying talk with Mrs. Allan; and finally in the evening
      she went with Matthew for the cows, through Lovers’ Lane to the back
      pasture. The woods were all gloried through with sunset and the warm splendor
      of it streamed down through the hill gaps in the west. Matthew walked slowly
      with bent head; Anne, tall and erect, suited her springing step to his.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “You’ve been working too hard today, Matthew,” she said
      reproachfully. “Why won’t you take things easier?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Well now, I can’t seem to,” said Matthew, as he opened the
      yard gate to let the cows through. “It’s only that I’m
      getting old, Anne, and keep forgetting it. Well, well, I’ve always worked
      pretty hard and I’d rather drop in harness.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “If I had been the boy you sent for,” said Anne wistfully,
      “I’d be able to help you so much now and spare you in a hundred
      ways. I could find it in my heart to wish I had been, just for that.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Well now, I’d rather have you than a dozen boys, Anne,” said
      Matthew patting her hand. “Just mind you that—rather than a dozen
      boys. Well now, I guess it wasn’t a boy that took the Avery scholarship,
      was it? It was a girl—my girl—my girl that I’m proud
      of.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      He smiled his shy smile at her as he went into the yard. Anne took the memory
      of it with her when she went to her room that night and sat for a long while at
      her open window, thinking of the past and dreaming of the future. Outside the
      Snow Queen was mistily white in the moonshine; the frogs were singing in the
      marsh beyond Orchard Slope. Anne always remembered the silvery, peaceful beauty
      and fragrant calm of that night. It was the last night before sorrow touched
      her life; and no life is ever quite the same again when once that cold,
      sanctifying touch has been laid upon it.

      CHAPTER XXXVII.<br>
      The Reaper Whose Name Is Death</h2>
    
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>ATTHEW—Matthew—what is the matter? Matthew, are you
      sick?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      It was Marilla who spoke, alarm in every jerky word. Anne came through the
      hall, her hands full of white narcissus,—it was long before Anne could
      love the sight or odor of white narcissus again,—in time to hear her and
      to see Matthew standing in the porch doorway, a folded paper in his hand, and
      his face strangely drawn and gray. Anne dropped her flowers and sprang across
      the kitchen to him at the same moment as Marilla. They were both too late;
      before they could reach him Matthew had fallen across the threshold.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “He’s fainted,” gasped Marilla. “Anne, run for
      Martin—quick, quick! He’s at the barn.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Martin, the hired man, who had just driven home from the post office, started
      at once for the doctor, calling at Orchard Slope on his way to send Mr. and
      Mrs. Barry over. Mrs. Lynde, who was there on an errand, came too. They found
      Anne and Marilla distractedly trying to restore Matthew to consciousness.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Mrs. Lynde pushed them gently aside, tried his pulse, and then laid her ear
      over his heart. She looked at their anxious faces sorrowfully and the tears
      came into her eyes.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Oh, Marilla,” she said gravely. “I don’t
      think—we can do anything for him.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Mrs. Lynde, you don’t think—you can’t think Matthew
      is—is—” Anne could not say the dreadful word; she turned sick
      and pallid.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Child, yes, I’m afraid of it. Look at his face. When you’ve
      seen that look as often as I have you’ll know what it means.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Anne looked at the still face and there beheld the seal of the Great Presence.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      When the doctor came he said that death had been instantaneous and probably
      painless, caused in all likelihood by some sudden shock. The secret of the
      shock was discovered to be in the paper Matthew had held and which Martin had
      brought from the office that morning. It contained an account of the failure of
      the Abbey Bank.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The news spread quickly through Avonlea, and all day friends and neighbors
      thronged Green Gables and came and went on errands of kindness for the dead and
      living. For the first time shy, quiet Matthew Cuthbert was a person of central
      importance; the white majesty of death had fallen on him and set him apart as
      one crowned.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      When the calm night came softly down over Green Gables the old house was hushed
      and tranquil. In the parlor lay Matthew Cuthbert in his coffin, his long gray
      hair framing his placid face on which there was a little kindly smile as if he
      but slept, dreaming pleasant dreams. There were flowers about him—sweet
      old-fashioned flowers which his mother had planted in the homestead garden in
      her bridal days and for which Matthew had always had a secret, wordless love.
      Anne had gathered them and brought them to him, her anguished, tearless eyes
      burning in her white face. It was the last thing she could do for him.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The Barrys and Mrs. Lynde stayed with them that night. Diana, going to the east
      gable, where Anne was standing at her window, said gently:
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Anne dear, would you like to have me sleep with you tonight?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Thank you, Diana.” Anne looked earnestly into her friend’s
      face. “I think you won’t misunderstand me when I say I want to be
      alone. I’m not afraid. I haven’t been alone one minute since it
      happened—and I want to be. I want to be quite silent and quiet and try to
      realize it. I can’t realize it. Half the time it seems to me that Matthew
      can’t be dead; and the other half it seems as if he must have been dead
      for a long time and I’ve had this horrible dull ache ever since.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Diana did not quite understand. Marilla’s impassioned grief, breaking all
      the bounds of natural reserve and lifelong habit in its stormy rush, she could
      comprehend better than Anne’s tearless agony. But she went away kindly,
      leaving Anne alone to keep her first vigil with sorrow.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Anne hoped that the tears would come in solitude. It seemed to her a terrible
      thing that she could not shed a tear for Matthew, whom she had loved so much
      and who had been so kind to her, Matthew who had walked with her last evening
      at sunset and was now lying in the dim room below with that awful peace on his
      brow. But no tears came at first, even when she knelt by her window in the
      darkness and prayed, looking up to the stars beyond the hills—no tears,
      only the same horrible dull ache of misery that kept on aching until she fell
      asleep, worn out with the day’s pain and excitement.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      In the night she awakened, with the stillness and the darkness about her, and
      the recollection of the day came over her like a wave of sorrow. She could see
      Matthew’s face smiling at her as he had smiled when they parted at the
      gate that last evening—she could hear his voice saying, “My
      girl—my girl that I’m proud of.” Then the tears came and Anne
      wept her heart out. Marilla heard her and crept in to comfort her.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “There—there—don’t cry so, dearie. It can’t bring
      him back. It—it—isn’t right to cry so. I knew that today, but
      I couldn’t help it then. He’d always been such a good, kind brother
      to me—but God knows best.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Oh, just let me cry, Marilla,” sobbed Anne. “The tears
      don’t hurt me like that ache did. Stay here for a little while with me
      and keep your arm round me—so. I couldn’t have Diana stay,
      she’s good and kind and sweet—but it’s not her
      sorrow—she’s outside of it and she couldn’t come close enough
      to my heart to help me. It’s our sorrow—yours and mine. Oh,
      Marilla, what will we do without him?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “We’ve got each other, Anne. I don’t know what I’d do
      if you weren’t here—if you’d never come. Oh, Anne, I know
      I’ve been kind of strict and harsh with you maybe—but you
      mustn’t think I didn’t love you as well as Matthew did, for all
      that. I want to tell you now when I can. It’s never been easy for me to
      say things out of my heart, but at times like this it’s easier. I love
      you as dear as if you were my own flesh and blood and you’ve been my joy
      and comfort ever since you came to Green Gables.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Two days afterwards they carried Matthew Cuthbert over his homestead threshold
      and away from the fields he had tilled and the orchards he had loved and the
      trees he had planted; and then Avonlea settled back to its usual placidity and
      even at Green Gables affairs slipped into their old groove and work was done
      and duties fulfilled with regularity as before, although always with the aching
      sense of “loss in all familiar things.” Anne, new to grief, thought
      it almost sad that it could be so—that they <i>could</i> go on in the old
      way without Matthew. She felt something like shame and remorse when she
      discovered that the sunrises behind the firs and the pale pink buds opening in
      the garden gave her the old inrush of gladness when she saw them—that
      Diana’s visits were pleasant to her and that Diana’s merry words
      and ways moved her to laughter and smiles—that, in brief, the beautiful
      world of blossom and love and friendship had lost none of its power to please
      her fancy and thrill her heart, that life still called to her with many
      insistent voices.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “It seems like disloyalty to Matthew, somehow, to find pleasure in these
      things now that he has gone,” she said wistfully to Mrs. Allan one
      evening when they were together in the manse garden. “I miss him so
      much—all the time—and yet, Mrs. Allan, the world and life seem very
      beautiful and interesting to me for all. Today Diana said something funny and I
      found myself laughing. I thought when it happened I could never laugh again.
      And it somehow seems as if I oughtn’t to.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “When Matthew was here he liked to hear you laugh and he liked to know
      that you found pleasure in the pleasant things around you,” said Mrs.
      Allan gently. “He is just away now; and he likes to know it just the
      same. I am sure we should not shut our hearts against the healing influences
      that nature offers us. But I can understand your feeling. I think we all
      experience the same thing. We resent the thought that anything can please us
      when someone we love is no longer here to share the pleasure with us, and we
      almost feel as if we were unfaithful to our sorrow when we find our interest in
      life returning to us.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I was down to the graveyard to plant a rosebush on Matthew’s grave
      this afternoon,” said Anne dreamily. “I took a slip of the little
      white Scotch rosebush his mother brought out from Scotland long ago; Matthew
      always liked those roses the best—they were so small and sweet on their
      thorny stems. It made me feel glad that I could plant it by his grave—as
      if I were doing something that must please him in taking it there to be near
      him. I hope he has roses like them in heaven. Perhaps the souls of all those
      little white roses that he has loved so many summers were all there to meet
      him. I must go home now. Marilla is all alone and she gets lonely at
      twilight.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “She will be lonelier still, I fear, when you go away again to
      college,” said Mrs. Allan.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Anne did not reply; she said good night and went slowly back to Green Gables.
      Marilla was sitting on the front door-steps and Anne sat down beside her. The
      door was open behind them, held back by a big pink conch shell with hints of
      sea sunsets in its smooth inner convolutions.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Anne gathered some sprays of pale-yellow honeysuckle and put them in her hair.
      She liked the delicious hint of fragrance, as some aerial benediction, above
      her every time she moved.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Doctor Spencer was here while you were away,” Marilla said.
      “He says that the specialist will be in town tomorrow and he insists that
      I must go in and have my eyes examined. I suppose I’d better go and have
      it over. I’ll be more than thankful if the man can give me the right kind
      of glasses to suit my eyes. You won’t mind staying here alone while
      I’m away, will you? Martin will have to drive me in and there’s
      ironing and baking to do.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I shall be all right. Diana will come over for company for me. I shall
      attend to the ironing and baking beautifully—you needn’t fear that
      I’ll starch the handkerchiefs or flavor the cake with liniment.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Marilla laughed.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “What a girl you were for making mistakes in them days, Anne. You were
      always getting into scrapes. I did use to think you were possessed. Do you mind
      the time you dyed your hair?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Yes, indeed. I shall never forget it,” smiled Anne, touching the
      heavy braid of hair that was wound about her shapely head. “I laugh a
      little now sometimes when I think what a worry my hair used to be to
      me—but I don’t laugh <i>much</i>, because it was a very real
      trouble then. I did suffer terribly over my hair and my freckles. My freckles
      are really gone; and people are nice enough to tell me my hair is auburn
      now—all but Josie Pye. She informed me yesterday that she really thought
      it was redder than ever, or at least my black dress made it look redder, and
      she asked me if people who had red hair ever got used to having it. Marilla,
      I’ve almost decided to give up trying to like Josie Pye. I’ve made
      what I would once have called a heroic effort to like her, but Josie Pye
      won’t <i>be</i> liked.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Josie is a Pye,” said Marilla sharply, “so she can’t
      help being disagreeable. I suppose people of that kind serve some useful
      purpose in society, but I must say I don’t know what it is any more than
      I know the use of thistles. Is Josie going to teach?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “No, she is going back to Queen’s next year. So are Moody Spurgeon
      and Charlie Sloane. Jane and Ruby are going to teach and they have both got
      schools—Jane at Newbridge and Ruby at some place up west.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Gilbert Blythe is going to teach too, isn’t he?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Yes”—briefly.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “What a nice-looking fellow he is,” said Marilla absently. “I
      saw him in church last Sunday and he seemed so tall and manly. He looks a lot
      like his father did at the same age. John Blythe was a nice boy. We used to be
      real good friends, he and I. People called him my beau.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Anne looked up with swift interest.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Oh, Marilla—and what happened?—why didn’t
      you—”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “We had a quarrel. I wouldn’t forgive him when he asked me to. I
      meant to, after awhile—but I was sulky and angry and I wanted to punish
      him first. He never came back—the Blythes were all mighty independent.
      But I always felt—rather sorry. I’ve always kind of wished
      I’d forgiven him when I had the chance.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “So you’ve had a bit of romance in your life, too,” said Anne
      softly.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Yes, I suppose you might call it that. You wouldn’t think so to
      look at me, would you? But you never can tell about people from their outsides.
      Everybody has forgot about me and John. I’d forgotten myself. But it all
      came back to me when I saw Gilbert last Sunday.”

      next day and returned in the evening. Anne had gone over to Orchard Slope with
      Diana and came back to find Marilla in the kitchen, sitting by the table with
      her head leaning on her hand. Something in her dejected attitude struck a chill
      to Anne’s heart. She had never seen Marilla sit limply inert like that.
    </p>

      “Are you very tired, Marilla?”

      “Yes—no—I don’t know,” said Marilla wearily,
      looking up. “I suppose I am tired but I haven’t thought about it.
      It’s not that.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Did you see the oculist? What did he say?” asked Anne anxiously.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Yes, I saw him. He examined my eyes. He says that if I give up all
      reading and sewing entirely and any kind of work that strains the eyes, and if
      I’m careful not to cry, and if I wear the glasses he’s given me he
      thinks my eyes may not get any worse and my headaches will be cured. But if I
      don’t he says I’ll certainly be stone-blind in six months. Blind!
      Anne, just think of it!”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      For a minute Anne, after her first quick exclamation of dismay, was silent. It
      seemed to her that she could <i>not</i> speak. Then she said bravely, but with
      a catch in her voice:
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Marilla, <i>don’t</i> think of it. You know he has given you hope.
      If you are careful you won’t lose your sight altogether; and if his
      glasses cure your headaches it will be a great thing.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I don’t call it much hope,” said Marilla bitterly.
      “What am I to live for if I can’t read or sew or do anything like
      that? I might as well be blind—or dead. And as for crying, I can’t
      help that when I get lonesome. But there, it’s no good talking about it.
      If you’ll get me a cup of tea I’ll be thankful. I’m about
      done out. Don’t say anything about this to any one for a spell yet,
      anyway. I can’t bear that folks should come here to question and
      sympathize and talk about it.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      When Marilla had eaten her lunch Anne persuaded her to go to bed. Then Anne
      went herself to the east gable and sat down by her window in the darkness alone
      with her tears and her heaviness of heart. How sadly things had changed since
      she had sat there the night after coming home! Then she had been full of hope
      and joy and the future had looked rosy with promise. Anne felt as if she had
      lived years since then, but before she went to bed there was a smile on her
      lips and peace in her heart. She had looked her duty courageously in the face
      and found it a friend—as duty ever is when we meet it frankly.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      One afternoon a few days later Marilla came slowly in from the front yard where
      she had been talking to a caller—a man whom Anne knew by sight as Sadler
      from Carmody. Anne wondered what he could have been saying to bring that look
      to Marilla’s face.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “What did Mr. Sadler want, Marilla?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Marilla sat down by the window and looked at Anne. There were tears in her eyes
      in defiance of the oculist’s prohibition and her voice broke as she said:
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “He heard that I was going to sell Green Gables and he wants to buy
      it.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Buy it! Buy Green Gables?” Anne wondered if she had heard aright.
      “Oh, Marilla, you don’t mean to sell Green Gables!”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Anne, I don’t know what else is to be done. I’ve thought it
      all over. If my eyes were strong I could stay here and make out to look after
      things and manage, with a good hired man. But as it is I can’t. I may
      lose my sight altogether; and anyway I’ll not be fit to run things. Oh, I
      never thought I’d live to see the day when I’d have to sell my
      home. But things would only go behind worse and worse all the time, till nobody
      would want to buy it. Every cent of our money went in that bank; and
      there’s some notes Matthew gave last fall to pay. Mrs. Lynde advises me
      to sell the farm and board somewhere—with her I suppose. It won’t
      bring much—it’s small and the buildings are old. But it’ll be
      enough for me to live on I reckon. I’m thankful you’re provided for
      with that scholarship, Anne. I’m sorry you won’t have a home to
      come to in your vacations, that’s all, but I suppose you’ll manage
      somehow.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Marilla broke down and wept bitterly.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “You mustn’t sell Green Gables,” said Anne resolutely.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Oh, Anne, I wish I didn’t have to. But you can see for yourself. I
      can’t stay here alone. I’d go crazy with trouble and loneliness.
      And my sight would go—I know it would.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “You won’t have to stay here alone, Marilla. I’ll be with
      you. I’m not going to Redmond.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Not going to Redmond!” Marilla lifted her worn face from her hands
      and looked at Anne. “Why, what do you mean?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Just what I say. I’m not going to take the scholarship. I decided
      so the night after you came home from town. You surely don’t think I
      could leave you alone in your trouble, Marilla, after all you’ve done for
      me. I’ve been thinking and planning. Let me tell you my plans. Mr. Barry
      wants to rent the farm for next year. So you won’t have any bother over
      that. And I’m going to teach. I’ve applied for the school
      here—but I don’t expect to get it for I understand the trustees
      have promised it to Gilbert Blythe. But I can have the Carmody school—Mr.
      Blair told me so last night at the store. Of course that won’t be quite
      as nice or convenient as if I had the Avonlea school. But I can board home and
      drive myself over to Carmody and back, in the warm weather at least. And even
      in winter I can come home Fridays. We’ll keep a horse for that. Oh, I
      have it all planned out, Marilla. And I’ll read to you and keep you
      cheered up. You sha’n’t be dull or lonesome. And we’ll be
      real cozy and happy here together, you and I.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Marilla had listened like a woman in a dream.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Oh, Anne, I could get on real well if you were here, I know. But I
      can’t let you sacrifice yourself so for me. It would be terrible.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Nonsense!” Anne laughed merrily. “There is no sacrifice.
      Nothing could be worse than giving up Green Gables—nothing could hurt me
      more. We must keep the dear old place. My mind is quite made up, Marilla.
      I’m <i>not</i> going to Redmond; and I <i>am</i> going to stay here and
      teach. Don’t you worry about me a bit.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “But your ambitions—and—”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I’m just as ambitious as ever. Only, I’ve changed the object
      of my ambitions. I’m going to be a good teacher—and I’m going
      to save your eyesight. Besides, I mean to study at home here and take a little
      college course all by myself. Oh, I’ve dozens of plans, Marilla.
      I’ve been thinking them out for a week. I shall give life here my best,
      and I believe it will give its best to me in return. When I left Queen’s
      my future seemed to stretch out before me like a straight road. I thought I
      could see along it for many a milestone. Now there is a bend in it. I
      don’t know what lies around the bend, but I’m going to believe that
      the best does. It has a fascination of its own, that bend, Marilla. I wonder
      how the road beyond it goes—what there is of green glory and soft,
      checkered light and shadows—what new landscapes—what new
      beauties—what curves and hills and valleys further on.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I don’t feel as if I ought to let you give it up,” said
      Marilla, referring to the scholarship.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “But you can’t prevent me. I’m sixteen and a half,
      ‘obstinate as a mule,’ as Mrs. Lynde once told me,” laughed
      Anne. “Oh, Marilla, don’t you go pitying me. I don’t like to
      be pitied, and there is no need for it. I’m heart glad over the very
      thought of staying at dear Green Gables. Nobody could love it as you and I
      do—so we must keep it.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “You blessed girl!” said Marilla, yielding. “I feel as if
      you’d given me new life. I guess I ought to stick out and make you go to
      college—but I know I can’t, so I ain’t going to try.
      I’ll make it up to you though, Anne.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      When it became noised abroad in Avonlea that Anne Shirley had given up the idea
      of going to college and intended to stay home and teach there was a good deal
      of discussion over it. Most of the good folks, not knowing about
      Marilla’s eyes, thought she was foolish. Mrs. Allan did not. She told
      Anne so in approving words that brought tears of pleasure to the girl’s
      eyes. Neither did good Mrs. Lynde. She came up one evening and found Anne and
      Marilla sitting at the front door in the warm, scented summer dusk. They liked
      to sit there when the twilight came down and the white moths flew about in the
      garden and the odor of mint filled the dewy air.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Mrs. Rachel deposited her substantial person upon the stone bench by the door,
      behind which grew a row of tall pink and yellow hollyhocks, with a long breath
      of mingled weariness and relief.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I declare I’m getting glad to sit down. I’ve been on my feet
      all day, and two hundred pounds is a good bit for two feet to carry round.
      It’s a great blessing not to be fat, Marilla. I hope you appreciate it.
      Well, Anne, I hear you’ve given up your notion of going to college. I was
      real glad to hear it. You’ve got as much education now as a woman can be
      comfortable with. I don’t believe in girls going to college with the men
      and cramming their heads full of Latin and Greek and all that nonsense.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “But I’m going to study Latin and Greek just the same, Mrs.
      Lynde,” said Anne laughing. “I’m going to take my Arts course
      right here at Green Gables, and study everything that I would at
      college.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Mrs. Lynde lifted her hands in holy horror.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Anne Shirley, you’ll kill yourself.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Not a bit of it. I shall thrive on it. Oh, I’m not going to overdo
      things. As ‘Josiah Allen’s wife,’ says, I shall be
      ‘mejum’. But I’ll have lots of spare time in the long winter
      evenings, and I’ve no vocation for fancy work. I’m going to teach
      over at Carmody, you know.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I don’t know it. I guess you’re going to teach right here in
      Avonlea. The trustees have decided to give you the school.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Mrs. Lynde!” cried Anne, springing to her feet in her surprise.
      “Why, I thought they had promised it to Gilbert Blythe!”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “So they did. But as soon as Gilbert heard that you had applied for it he
      went to them—they had a business meeting at the school last night, you
      know—and told them that he withdrew his application, and suggested that
      they accept yours. He said he was going to teach at White Sands. Of course he
      knew how much you wanted to stay with Marilla, and I must say I think it was
      real kind and thoughtful in him, that’s what. Real self-sacrificing, too,
      for he’ll have his board to pay at White Sands, and everybody knows
      he’s got to earn his own way through college. So the trustees decided to
      take you. I was tickled to death when Thomas came home and told me.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I don’t feel that I ought to take it,” murmured Anne.
      “I mean—I don’t think I ought to let Gilbert make such a
      sacrifice for—for me.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I guess you can’t prevent him now. He’s signed papers with
      the White Sands trustees. So it wouldn’t do him any good now if you were
      to refuse. Of course you’ll take the school. You’ll get along all
      right, now that there are no Pyes going. Josie was the last of them, and a good
      thing she was, that’s what. There’s been some Pye or other going to
      Avonlea school for the last twenty years, and I guess their mission in life was
      to keep school teachers reminded that earth isn’t their home. Bless my
      heart! What does all that winking and blinking at the Barry gable mean?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Diana is signaling for me to go over,” laughed Anne. “You
      know we keep up the old custom. Excuse me while I run over and see what she
      wants.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Anne ran down the clover slope like a deer, and disappeared in the firry
      shadows of the Haunted Wood. Mrs. Lynde looked after her indulgently.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “There’s a good deal of the child about her yet in some
      ways.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “There’s a good deal more of the woman about her in others,”
      retorted Marilla, with a momentary return of her old crispness.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      But crispness was no longer Marilla’s distinguishing characteristic. As
      Mrs. Lynde told her Thomas that night.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Marilla Cuthbert has got <i>mellow</i>. That’s what.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Anne went to the little Avonlea graveyard the next evening to put fresh flowers
      on Matthew’s grave and water the Scotch rosebush. She lingered there
      until dusk, liking the peace and calm of the little place, with its poplars
      whose rustle was like low, friendly speech, and its whispering grasses growing
      at will among the graves. When she finally left it and walked down the long
      hill that sloped to the Lake of Shining Waters it was past sunset and all
      Avonlea lay before her in a dreamlike afterlight—“a haunt of
      ancient peace.” There was a freshness in the air as of a wind that had
      blown over honey-sweet fields of clover. Home lights twinkled out here and
      there among the homestead trees. Beyond lay the sea, misty and purple, with its
      haunting, unceasing murmur. The west was a glory of soft mingled hues, and the
      pond reflected them all in still softer shadings. The beauty of it all thrilled
      Anne’s heart, and she gratefully opened the gates of her soul to it.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Dear old world,” she murmured, “you are very lovely, and I
      am glad to be alive in you.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Halfway down the hill a tall lad came whistling out of a gate before the Blythe
      homestead. It was Gilbert, and the whistle died on his lips as he recognized
      Anne. He lifted his cap courteously, but he would have passed on in silence, if
      Anne had not stopped and held out her hand.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Gilbert,” she said, with scarlet cheeks, “I want to thank
      you for giving up the school for me. It was very good of you—and I want
      you to know that I appreciate it.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Gilbert took the offered hand eagerly.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “It wasn’t particularly good of me at all, Anne. I was pleased to
      be able to do you some small service. Are we going to be friends after this?
      Have you really forgiven me my old fault?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Anne laughed and tried unsuccessfully to withdraw her hand.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I forgave you that day by the pond landing, although I didn’t know
      it. What a stubborn little goose I was. I’ve been—I may as well
      make a complete confession—I’ve been sorry ever since.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “We are going to be the best of friends,” said Gilbert, jubilantly.
      “We were born to be good friends, Anne. You’ve thwarted destiny
      enough. I know we can help each other in many ways. You are going to keep up
      your studies, aren’t you? So am I. Come, I’m going to walk home
      with you.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Marilla looked curiously at Anne when the latter entered the kitchen.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Who was that came up the lane with you, Anne?”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Gilbert Blythe,” answered Anne, vexed to find herself blushing.
      “I met him on Barry’s hill.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “I didn’t think you and Gilbert Blythe were such good friends that
      you’d stand for half an hour at the gate talking to him,” said
      Marilla with a dry smile.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “We haven’t been—we’ve been good enemies. But we have
      decided that it will be much more sensible to be good friends in the future.
      Were we really there half an hour? It seemed just a few minutes. But, you see,
      we have five years’ lost conversations to catch up with, Marilla.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Anne sat long at her window that night companioned by a glad content. The wind
      purred softly in the cherry boughs, and the mint breaths came up to her. The
      stars twinkled over the pointed firs in the hollow and Diana’s light
      gleamed through the old gap.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Anne’s horizons had closed in since the night she had sat there after
      coming home from Queen’s; but if the path set before her feet was to be
      narrow she knew that flowers of quiet happiness would bloom along it. The joy
      of sincere work and worthy aspiration and congenial friendship were to be hers;
      nothing could rob her of her birthright of fancy or her ideal world of dreams.
      And there was always the bend in the road!
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “‘God’s in his heaven, all’s right with the
      world,’” whispered Anne softly.
